pub.1134662409,ur.01260251732.01,UNF,"Boling, Michelle C.",Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,In Vivo Compositional Changes in the Articular Cartilage of the Patellofemoral Joint Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"OBJECTIVE: To compare T1ρ relaxation times of the medial and lateral regions of the patella and femoral trochlea at 6 and 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) on the ACLR and contralateral extremity. Greater T1ρ relaxation times are associated with a lower proteoglycan density of articular cartilage.
METHODS: This study involved 20 individuals (11 males, 9 females; mean ± SD age 22 ± 3.9 years, weight 76.11 ± 13.48 kg, and height 178.32 ± 12.32 cm) who underwent a previous unilateral ACLR using a patellar tendon autograft. Magnetic resonance images from both extremities were acquired at 6 and 12 months post-ACLR. Voxel by voxel T1ρ relaxation times were calculated using a 5-image sequence. The medial and lateral regions of the femoral trochlea and patellar articular cartilage were manually segmented on both extremities. Separate extremity (ACLR and contralateral extremity) by time (6 months and 12 months) analysis of variance tests were performed for each region (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: For the medial patella and lateral trochlea, T1ρ relaxation times increased in both extremities between 6 and 12 months post-ACLR (medial patella P = 0.012; lateral trochlea P = 0.043). For the lateral patella, T1ρ relaxation times were significantly greater on the contralateral extremity compared to the ACLR extremity (P = 0.001). The T1ρ relaxation times of the medial trochlea on the ACLR extremity were significantly greater at 6 (P = 0.005) and 12 months (P < 0.001) compared to the contralateral extremity. T1ρ relaxation times of the medial trochlea significantly increased from 6 to 12 months on the ACLR extremity (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Changes in T1ρ relaxation times occur within the first 12 months following ACLR in specific regions of the patellofemoral joint on the ACLR and contralateral extremity."

A spanning subgraph G ′ of G is a k-hop spanner if and only if for every edge p q ∈ G , there is a path between p , q in G ′ with at most k edges. We obtain the following results for unit disk graphs in the plane. (i) Every n-vertex unit disk graph has a 5-hop spanner with at most 5.5n edges. We analyze the family of spanners constructed by Biniaz (2020) and improve the upper bound on the number of edges from 9n to 5.5n. (ii) Using a new construction, we show that every n-vertex unit disk graph has a 3-hop spanner with at most 11n edges. (iii) Every n-vertex unit disk graph has a 2-hop spanner with O ( n log ⁡ n ) edges. This is the first nontrivial construction of 2-hop spanners. (iv) For every sufficiently large positive integer n, there exists a set P of n points on a circle, such that every plane hop spanner on P has hop stretch factor at least 4. Previously, no lower bound greater than 2 was known. (v) For every finite point set on a circle, there exists a plane (i.e., crossing-free) 4-hop spanner. As such, this provides a tight bound for points on a circle. (vi) The maximum degree of k-hop spanners cannot be bounded from above by a function of k for any positive integer k."

The use of an elastic continuum model has offered implicit equations for assessing folded acoustic modes (FAMs) and their splitting at the center and at the edge of mini-Brillouin zone. In (BeTe)m/(ZnSe)n SLs grown with Zn–Te interfaces, the Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed well resolved first order doublet and frequency shifts which compared favorably well with the simulated results. For the graded (BeX)10-Δ/(Be0.5Zn0.5X)Δ/(ZnX)10-Δ/(Be0.5Zn0.5X)Δ SLs, we have adopted a modified linear-chain model by meticulously integrating the effects of alloying and interfacial layer thickness Δ to study phonon dispersions ( ω j ( q → S L )) and Raman intensity profiles. By changing Δ from 1 to 3 monolayers, our study has distinctly revealed (a) a dramatic increase in the Raman scattering intensity of ZnX quasi-confined optical modes (Q-COMs) with slight upward shifts in frequencies, (b) an insignificant change in Raman intensity lines of BeX confined optical modes (COMs) with appreciable downward shifts (up to ∼ - 113 cm−1) in frequencies, and (c) trivial modifications in the FAMs. These atypical effects noticed in the optical modes are attributed to the localization of atomic displacements at the BeX-ZnX interfacial region. The variations of phonon mode frequencies and enhancement of Raman lines for the ZnX Q-COMs can be used as vital tools for establishing interfacial structures in graded SLs of technological importance."

 Janusene is a [3,3] ortho -cyclophane that possesses four aromatic moieties of which two are held together in a quasi-parallel or in a cleft-shaped arrangement. The multiple coordination sites available in janusene were tested by bonding of Ag + ions in different positions of the janusene structure, leading to 35 systems. Our results evidence that janusene is able to stabilize up to five Ag + ions simultaneously. Due to the symmetric coordination positions, several isomers have been obtained with systems containing up to 4 Ag + ions. Janusene–Ag + interactions, for all systems, are partially covalent in nature, mainly stabilized by Δ E orb and Δ E ele interactions. MEP isosurfaces reveal that the different Ag + coordination modifies the janusene electron density, thus modulating the reactivity of its rings. Janusene is also able to stabilize, by ≈−130 kcal mol −1 , a [Ag A ⋯Ag B ] 2+ interaction at short distances, in the cleft between facial rings. Interestingly, these interactions are enhanced by coordination of other Ag + ions, increasing the lateral rings’ orbital interactions to the stabilization of the [Ag A ⋯Ag B ] 2+ interaction. This study reveals the presence of some unusual and previously unexplored features of janusene's electronic structure. "

In some studies including preventive HIV vaccine efficacy trials, some participants have biomarkers measured starting at the time origin, whereas others have biomarkers measured starting later with the time origin unknown. The semiparametric additive time-varying coefficient model is investigated where the effects of some covariates vary nonparametrically with time while the effects of others remain constant. Weighted profile least squares estimators coupled with kernel smoothing are developed. The method uses the expectation maximization approach to deal with the censored time origin. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and other failure time regression models such as the Cox model can be utilized to estimate the distribution and the conditional distribution of left censored event time related to the censored time origin. Asymptotic properties of the parametric and nonparametric estimators and consistent asymptotic variance estimators are derived. A two-stage estimation procedure for choosing weight is proposed to improve estimation efficiency. Numerical simulations are conducted to examine finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. The simulation results show that the theory and methods work well. The efficiency gain of the two-stage estimation procedure depends on the distribution of the longitudinal error processes. The method is applied to analyze data from the Merck 023/HVTN 502 Step HIV vaccine study."

Law, in particular, will have to embrace such a holistic earth system perspective in order to deal more effectively with the Anthropocene's predicaments. While a growing number of scholars have tried to reimagine law and legal scholarship in a more holistic way, these attempts remain siloed. What is required is a shared epistemic framework to enable and enhance collaborative intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and co-learning that go hand in hand with thorough transdisciplinary stakeholder engagement. We argue that the nascent concept of earth system law offers such an overarching epistemic framework. This article serves as an invitation to fellow explorers from various legal fields, other disciplines, and from a wide range of stakeholders to explore new frontiers in earth system law. Our aim is to further stimulate the study of earth system law, and to encourage collaboration and co-learning in a fertile epistemic space that we share."

Explicit calculations are performed for isolated 32 S P + (34 S P + ) defects, nearest-neighbor 32 S P + - C u G a 2 - (34 S P + - C u G a 2 - ) pairs in GaP, and next-nearest-neighbor complex 32 S S b + - G a S b 2 - (34 S S b + - G a S b 2 - ) center in GaSb by using apposite perturbation ( P ↔ ) and Green’s function ( G ↔ o ) matrix elements. For the isolated closest mass isoelectronic and charged (donor and acceptor) defects, the study has provided a convincing empirical relationship associating the increase or decrease of force constant change between impurity-host atoms to the increase or decrease of covalency of impurity-host bond. The rule has accurately predicted the observed isotopic shifts of local vibrational and/or gap modes of isolated impurities and offered modes for different “donor–acceptor” pairs of reduced symmetry. We feel that the ATM-GF method will play a significant role identifying the site selectivity of defects for estimating their mode frequencies in the technologically important semiconductor materials."

Work-life interference/imbalance can result in work-related burnout, which has been shown to have negative effects on faculty members' physical and psychological health. Although our understanding of burnout has advanced considerably in recent years, little is known about the effects of burnout on nursing faculty turnover intentions and career satisfaction.
OBJECTIVE: To test a hypothesized model examining the effects of work-life interference on nursing faculty burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism), turnover intentions and, ultimately, career satisfaction.
DESIGN: A predictive cross-sectional design was used.
SETTINGS: An online national survey of nursing faculty members was administered throughout Canada in summer 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: Nursing faculty who held full-time or part-time positions in Canadian academic settings were invited via email to participate in the study.
METHODS: Data were collected from an anonymous survey housed on Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics and reliability estimates were computed. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling.
RESULTS: Data suggest that work-life interference significantly increases burnout which contributes to both higher turnover intentions and lower career satisfaction. Turnover intentions, in turn, decrease career satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to the growing body of literature linking burnout to turnover and dissatisfaction, highlighting key antecedents and/or drivers of burnout among nurse academics.

The combustion causes emission of greenhouse gases and particle pollution, which leads to health hazards. As people become increasingly conscious of their carbon footprints, they may choose to reduce their energy consumption using a variety of energy-saving technologies. We design a context-rich incentivized decision-making experiment in a laboratory set-up. The decision scenario has been enriched with elements of a public good, risk, and intertemporal discounting. Each subject represents a household and decides how much to spend on energy-saving technologies that can reduce future energy costs and emissions. The reduction in emission decreases health risk and medical costs for an individual and everyone else in the group. Discounting is represented by the ability to save, with interest. Each subject plays three sections (baseline, a treatment, and a repeated baseline). Each section had 30 rounds. The treatment has a threshold public good feature of energy-savings. The emission tax level depends on the aggregate energy-savings. Subjects exhibit significant learning effect and tend to increase adoption rate of energy-saving technologies over time. The adoption rate significantly improves when subjects can reduce their emission tax obligations by decreasing their energy consumption. There is no evidence of significant change in behavior when subjects learn energy-saving choices made by other group members."

Currently, it is unknown the extent to which differences in pain levels exist in individuals with PFP compared to asymptomatic controls during functional task and if pain differ across various functional tasks. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate pain levels between individuals with PFP and asymptomatic controls and compare pain severity across various functional tasks.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: OVID, SPORTSDiscus, CINAHL, Web of Science and Embase were searched for studies that included PFP and asymptomatic controls with pain assessed during a functional task. Pooled pain scores mean with 95% confidence intervals were calculated between groups across 11 functional tasks. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated based on Hedge's g effect sizes. Tasks whose SMD 95% confidence intervals were non-overlapping were considered significantly different.
RESULTS: 28 articles were included for data analysis. Pain was greater across 10 tasks (SMD = 1.52-6.08) in individuals with PFP compared to the asymptomatic controls with an average SMD of 2.45. Running and star excursion balance testing resulted in greater pain than walking. Limited evidence showed greater pain in sitting than seven other tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence exists for greater pain levels in individuals with PFP compared to asymptomatic controls in functional tasks. Pain was greater during running and star excursion balance compared to walking. Clinicians should assess knee pain before and after functional tasks to improve our understanding of patient specific pain experiences."

Referred to as IT consumerization, employees use their smartphones, notebooks and tablets in the workplace, accompanied by a growing toolbox of applications. Google Apps and Dropbox are just a few consumer tools that employees use to get their work done, and in doing so, often bypass the authority of the IT department and the organization. While some organizations discourage, or even prohibit, employees from using their personal IT, others embrace the phenomenon. Employees’ investment in consumer IT and its accompanying applications has been suggested as related to innovation and productivity gains, but there has been no empirical validation of such a beneficial relationship. With this paper we propose a theoretical root cause for the perceived positive outcomes of employees using their personal technologies in the workplace. Specifically, we explore the role of IT empowerment—a concept that captures the level of authority an employee assumes in utilizing IT in order to control or improve aspects of their job. Surveying 147 employees, we find support for increased levels of IT empowerment and higher levels of perceived performance among those that actively use consumer IT versus those that do not; we also find a close relationship between IT empowerment and perceived innovative work behaviors."

The aim of the current study is to examine specific aspects of cognition to explore their influence on self-harming behaviors. Participants included 101 undergraduates from a British University. Factors were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, Ruminative Response Scale, and the Automated Working Memory Assessment. Findings indicated a greater incidence of self-harming behaviors among those who demonstrated higher depressive symptoms, but depression scores were not significantly related to self-harm. Additionally, a binary logistic regression indicated that self-criticism was associated with the presence of self-harming behavior, and a Classification and Regression Trees found that the single strongest predictor of self-harming behavior was a belief that love needs to be continually earned from others. Incorporating treatments that reduce self-criticism, such as improving self-compassion with Compassionate Mind Training, may address underlying mechanisms that trigger self-harm behavior."

The aim of this study was to investigate different causes of blocking and discover the most effective solutions for writers. 146 writers completed an online, mixed-method survey about their experiences with writer’s block. Four causes of writer’s block were described by the respondents and supported by existing literature: physiological, motivational, cognitive, and behavioral. The most common causes of blocking were physiological and motivational, and interfered with the composition process of writing more often than idea generation. Writers described twelve effective solutions. The four most useful strategies were taking a break from writing, working on a different writing project, forcing themselves to keep writing, and discussing ideas with others. The findings also revealed an association between different causes of blocking and the cognitive processes involved with different parts of the writing process. Professional and semiprofessional writers did not significantly differ in the types of blocks they experienced, solutions they considered effective, and the length of writer’s block they experienced. The findings presented may provide readers with helpful strategies for overcoming writer’s block."

Like all plausible prebiotic chemistries, this system would have been altered by minerals and rocks in close contact with the evolving solutions. This study addresses the different types of perturbations that minerals might have on this chemical system.

Although meant to improve the operational performance of signalized intersections, such mobility enhancements may translate into substantial safety benefits. This study examined the safety effects of ASCT using an observational before–after empirical Bayes (EB) approach with a comparison group. The proposed approach was used to develop crash modification factors (CMFs) for total crashes, angle crashes, rear-end crashes, and specific crash severity levels [fatal or injury (FI) and property damage only (PDO) crashes]. The analysis included 42 treatment intersections with ASCT and their corresponding 47 comparison intersections without ASCT. Findings from the study indicated the potential of ASCT to improve the safety of signalized intersections since the CMFs for both ASCT systems (InSync and SynchroGreen) showed significant reductions in crashes. On average, the deployment of ASCT was found to significantly reduce the total, rear-end, FI, and PDO crashes by 5.2%, 12.2%, 4.2%, and 5.7%, respectively. These results were consistent between the two systems. Also, a 2.1% reduction in angle crashes was observed, although the reduction was not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. The findings from this study provide researchers and practitioners with an effective means to quantify the safety benefits of ASCT and conduct an economic appraisal of ASCT systems."

Virtual reality (VR), a computer technology that replicates an environment (real or imagined) and simulates a user’s physical presence in that environment to allow for user interaction, offers unique opportunities from a training perspective, such as allowing users to improve their skills without the consequence of failing real customers or the need to be in the real environment physically. This study aims to focus on comparing the effectiveness of VR hospitality training with that of real-world hospitality training.   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts situated cognition theory to empirically test the effect of the awareness of contextual variables (social interaction, location and task) on learning and compare learning outcomes between tourism training in VR and real-world experimental settings.   Findings Results indicate that location and task awareness enhance cognitive absorption, but social awareness does not influence cognitive absorption. There is no significant difference between training in real-world and VR environments. Finally, cognitive absorption has a positive effect on mental model change (the learning outcome).   Originality/value This result advances the theoretical understanding on the significance of learning context by applying situated cognition theory in hospitality training and has significant implications for training that aims for rigor and efficiency within cost, location and time constraints.

The purpose of this research is to examine the long-term change in (1) measured whole grains in food products, (2) Whole Grain Stamp usage and (3) the prominence of whole-grain ingredients and product categories, across the United States and Latin America. These changes were quantified by analyzing the Oldways Whole Grains Council's (WGC) Stamped Product Database from 2007 to 2020. Mean whole grains increased 36-76%, from 19 grams to 25.8 grams per serving in the U.S. and 18.1 grams to 31.9 grams per serving in Latin America. Whole Grain Stamp usage worldwide has increased from 250 products in 2005 to more than 13,000 products in 2020. These findings suggest that manufacturers are increasing the percentage of the grain that is whole in their products and developing more whole-grain products for consumers, thus providing an opportunity for consumers to meet national-level whole-grain recommendations."

This development makes studying DWAs increasingly difficult and challenges us to advance our methods that define how we can study, observe, and conceptualize DWAs. In this essay, we draw on the mathematical-logical formalism of the Laws of Form (LoF) (Spencer-Brown, 1969) to analyze how six illustrative IS studies conceptualize the social and the material to arrive at distinct perspectives on DWAs. Our analysis reveals three archetypes that capture these studies' conceptualizations and that inform a discussion of how IS research can extend qualitative methods beyond those six works. We offer two contributions. First, we provide novel insights and explanations to key conceptualizations in the study of DWAs. Second, we present the LoF as a pre-ontological and pre-theoretical formalism that enables commensurability of methods and development of novel qualitative empirical methods. Specifically, we demonstrate how the formalism helps articulating the distinctions we draw to refine our object of study and to critically examine and reconstruct other researchers' reasoning."

The objective was to reduce the severity of POD by implementing an interprofessional delirium-management.MethodsMulticentric quality-improvement project on five SU implementing a delirium-management with pre/post-comparison. Primary outcome was severity of POD, assessed with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). Secondary outcome parameters were POD incidence, duration, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), length of stay in SU and hospital, mortality, and others.ResultsOut of a total of 799 patients, 59.4% (n = 475) could be included with 9.5% (n = 45) being delirious. Implementation of a delirium-management led to reduced POD severity; Nu-DESC median: pre: 3.5 (interquartile range 2.6–4.7) vs. post 3.0 (2.2–4.0), albeit not significant (p = 0.154). Other outcome parameters were not meaningful different. In the post-period, delirium-management could be delivered to 75% (n = 18) of delirious patients, and only 24 (53.3%) of delirious patients required pharmacological treatments. Patients with a more severe stroke and POD remained on their disability levels, compared to similar affected, non-delirious patients who improved.ConclusionsImplementation of delirium-management on SU is feasible and can be delivered to most patients, but with limited effects. Nursing interventions as first choice could be delivered to the majority of patients, and only the half required pharmacological treatments. Delirium-management may lead to reduced severity of POD but had only partial effects on duration of POD or length of stay. POD hampers rehabilitation, especially in patients with more severe stroke.RegistryDRKS, DRKS00021436. Registered 04/17/2020, www.drks.de/DRKS00021436."

Recently, there has been an increasing amount of research in humanitarian relief supply chain performance measurement, which necessitates a thorough analysis of recent developments. To this end, this paper provides a systematic review of humanitarian supply chain performance measurement studies, through a categorical analysis of research articles. The authors identified and categorized research articles according to seven structural dimensions: disaster type, context of operation, disaster management phase, data analysis technique, level of analysis, performance measurement system development process, and performance measurement theme. This review intends to link the trends and theories in the broader body of performance measurement to the specific issues encountered in humanitarian supply chain performance measurement. A systematic literature review was developed by employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis methodology. The authors identified and reviewed 83 peer-reviewed journal articles that have appeared since 2007, the year in which the first journal article on humanitarian supply chain performance measurement was published. The review reveals that while there is a growing literature on humanitarian supply chain performance measurement, there is limited empirical evidence about performance measurement system implementation. This paper identifies two key research streams: contextual-based performance measurement and simulation and predictive performance measurement. This review contributes to theory by developing detailed categories of performance measurement studies and future research directions. The results are limited to peer-reviewed journals focusing on supply chain and operations management literature, and hence do not cover the literature from humanitarian organizations technical reports, independent evaluations and other academic fields such as organizational studies or accounting literature."

It uses a set of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are relations among multiple inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine whether the program under test is faulty. Typically, MRs vary in their ability to detect faults in the program under test, and some MRs tend to detect the same set of faults. In this paper, we propose approaches to prioritize MRs to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MT for regression testing. We present two MR prioritization approaches: (i) fault‐based and (ii) coverage‐based. To evaluate these MR prioritization approaches, we conduct experiments on three complex open‐source software systems. Our results show that the MR prioritization approaches developed by us significantly outperform the current practice of executing the source and follow‐up test cases of the MRs in an ad‐hoc manner in terms of fault detection effectiveness. Further, fault‐based MR prioritization leads to reducing the number of source and follow‐up test cases that needs to be executed as well as reducing the average time taken to detect a fault, which would result in saving time and cost during the testing process."

For the bulk BeX and ZnX materials, the simulations of energy band dispersions E j k → have offered the correct band gaps in very good agreement with the first-principles calculations. The band-mixing effect through the interfaces of two constituent compounds (BeX indirect- and ZnX direct-band gap) has played an important role for determining the overall band lineup in the (BeX)m /(ZnX)m SLs over the entire Brillouin zone. Based on the quantum confinement effects, the impact of stacking sequence m ≤ 10 is carefully examined for assessing the band structures of SLs. The results have clearly revealed that the nature of energy bandgaps is quite sensitive to the choice of well (BeX) and barrier (ZnX) layer thickness. Obviously, this intuition has implied that controlling m to achieve direct bandgaps in novel (BeX)m/(ZnX)m SLs is probably an effective way of assessing their potential use in technologically important optoelectronic devices."

Less is known about whether such policies affect where US citizens live. We examine whether implementation of employment‐ and police‐based enforcement measures affected less‐educated US citizens' and unauthorized Hispanic immigrants' interstate mobility during 2006–2018. The results indicate that Hispanic US citizens are repelled from states with police‐based enforcement, with the impact on inflows versus outflows depending on whether they are married to an unauthorized immigrant. White and Black US natives' mobility tends to respond less to enforcement measures.

Design: Focus group interviews with women, in conjunction with a community-based organization providing programs for underserved women with a mission of improved women and infant health.
Setting: Focus groups were conducted, and women were recruited from clinical sites in predominantly African American urban neighborhoods in a southeastern US city.
Patients: Self-identified 18-35-year-old women recruited from clinical sites in the urban core of the city with an 80% African American population.
Interventions: No interventions tested<b>.</b>
Main Outcome Measures: Black women's opinions and concerns about contraception.
Results: Key insights from the focus group results for healthcare providers include the following: the importance of framing discussions with patients within the context of the patients' goals; need to acknowledge and respect the support systems that women rely on for child birthing and childcare; recognition of the clinician's role as a trusted and respected source of information; and need to understand and be prepared to address much of the inaccurate and misleading information that can interfere with the patients' optimal choices for contraception.
Conclusions: A critical component for applying the implementation science theory to increase the use of evidence-based practices, such as implementation of highly effective contraceptives, requires understanding women's perspectives of the factors influencing their decisions to use highly effective contraceptives. This study provides important insights into the following: the potential barriers inherent in minoritized women's concerns about contraceptives and how these insights can inform implementation strategies such as patient-centered counseling and education to overcome those barriers."

A doubly-robust augmented inverse probability weighted complete-case (AIPW) approach to estimation and inference is investigated. This approach modifies IPW complete-case estimating equations by exploiting the key features in the relationship between the missing covariates and the phase-one data to improve efficiency. An iterative numerical procedure is derived to solve the nonlinear estimating equations. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. A simulation study examining the finite-sample performances of the proposed estimators shows that the AIPW estimators are more efficient than the IPW estimators. The developed method is applied to the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial to investigate vaccine-induced IgG binding antibodies to HIV-1 as correlates of acquisition of HIV-1 infection while taking account of whether the HIV-1 sequences are near or far from the HIV-1 sequences represented in the vaccine construct.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct an empirical study with a structural equation modeling approach to investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility—constructed by the quality and environmental responsibility, green supply chain management—including green supplier and customer management and operational performance—manifested by quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery performance using data from 308 manufacturers in China. Besides, the authors explore the moderating effect of supplier and customer relational capital on these relationships.   Findings The findings indicate that a company's quality and environmental responsibility significantly impacts its green supply chain management practices, which further improve its operational performance in quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery. In addition, supplier and customer relational capital strengthens the influence of environmental responsibility on green supply chain management. While supplier relational capital reinforces the impact of green supplier management on flexibility and delivery performance, customer relational capital only strengthens the influence of green customer management on flexibility performance.

In recent decades, while some Christian denominations in the United States have remained resolute in their condemnatory stance on these issues, the religious outputs of others have become more tolerant. A cross-cohort examination of the influence of religious identity and attendance at religious services on such attitudes can help uncover effects of this interplay over time.   Purpose The present study tests the significance of religious identity and attendance at religious services on attitudes toward same-sex relations and civil liberties for gays and lesbians, comparing young adults across the Baby Boomer, Generation X, and Millennial cohorts. The uniqueness of the study is twofold: (1) Cross-cohort analyses are used to compare young adults within a single study rather than examining each cohort in isolation, and (2) the analyses are contextualized within an open systems framework.   Methods Data from the General Social Survey are used to examine the significance of religious identity and attendance at religious services on the attitudes of young adults (ages 20–37) toward moral acceptance of same-sex relations and civil liberties of gays and lesbians. Multiple linear regression analyses are used to test for significant differences across three birth cohorts, controlling for relevant sociodemographics.   Results The analyses demonstrate cross-cohort change in the significance of religious identity on attitudes about the morality of same-sex relations and the civil liberties of gays and lesbians, while attendance at services is consistently a strong predictor across the generations. Of particular interest, among Millennial young adults, unlike previous generations, the evangelical Protestant identity does not affect attitudes about civil liberties for gays and lesbians.   Conclusions and Implications The findings suggest the importance of examining the interplay of religious outputs and societal inputs and how these dynamics influence public opinion over time. This study reveals a need for increased research into how societal inputs have shifted the output of religious organizations, not just toward gays and lesbians, but also other sexual and gender minorities.

Experiential learning opportunities can help students to gain knowledge and improve skillsets. The RD Mentorship Program was established to enhance professional development and knowledge by connecting nutrition students (NS) and registered dietitians (RD). This program used social exchange theory and Kolb's experiential learning theory to evaluate the impact. RD (n=238) and NS (n=302) across Texas and Florida participated in a 1-year, project-based mentoring program from 2016 to 2020. This program collected qualitative and quantitative data in this pre-post program design. While the sheer number of participants over the three academic years was a strength of the program, there were also some valuable lessons learned. Most participants rated their experience as satisfied to highly satisfied (6.7-8.7/10). Five key themes emerged from program evaluation: mutuality, opportunity, career development, diversity and inclusion and barrier. Mentorship, both virtually and in-person, can offer unique ""hands-on"" learning opportunities that bridge the gap between students and healthcare practitioners. The RD Mentorship Program models how mentorships can successfully be applied in diverse health professions."

However, the collapse of many bike-sharing startups and residual social problems has brought about contradictions and challenges to the development of the industry. The purpose of this paper is to determine how internal factors affect the survival of bike-sharing startups.   Design/methodology/approach The authors used binary logit regression as the measurement model to conduct an empirical analysis based on 137 bike-sharing startups in China. The study focuses on using traditional theoretical evidence and considers the uniqueness of the industry to jointly explore the survival factors that influence the emerging business model of bike-sharing.   Findings The results show that entrepreneurial team size and differentiation strategy positively influence survival. Founder-CEOs have a negative impact on survival. Founders' entrepreneurial experience and venture capital have no significant influence on survival.   Originality/value The results verify the role of traditional survival factors in the new business model of sharing economy and fill the research gap on the survival strategy of startups. This study offers a unique perspective for researchers to better understand the sharing economy industry and provides practical guidance for entrepreneurs and investors to enter the market. "

Accurate values of phonons generated by a realistic lattice-dynamical model are meticulously integrated to simulate the GFs and perturbation matrix elements for attaining the site selectivity of Si and Ge impurities in GaAs. By considering two nearest-neighbor (NN) donor–acceptor prototypes: (A) S i G a + - G e A s - and (B) G e G a + - S i A s - of C3v-symmetry with strict sets of perturbation parameters, we have cautiously appraised the two models by calculating their impurity vibrational modes. Careful analysis of the experimental vibrational traits has convincingly established the observed split modes at 403 and 373 cm−1 as radial ( a 1 + ) and transverse ( e + ) modes, respectively of a NN S i G a + - G e A s - p a i r where Ge acts as an acceptor. For this pair structure, the high frequency broad band at 403 cm−1 with several phonon features is justified by relating it to the five naturally occurring Ge isotopes. Although, the sharp line at 373 cm−1 overlaps with the 30SiGa isotopic LVM we, assigned it, however, to the transverse vibration of the pair-defect. In the two NN Ge-Si defect structures, the accuracy of calculated impurity modes is checked by using a simple model which correctly predicted isotopic shifts of the triply degenerate (F 2) phonons of isolated S i G a + and S i A s - impurities involved in the ( S i G a + - G e A s - and G e G a + - S i A s - ) donor–acceptor pairs. ____________________________________________________________________________"

This is done using point-laser systems mounted along the driver-side wheel path of friction evaluation vehicles. Historically, point-lasers have been recognized by the FDOT to accurately measure MPD on flexible pavement. However, current point-laser technology is unable to measure the anisotropic texturing of rigid pavement, such as longitudinal diamond ground (LDG) concrete. For this reason, the FDOT purchased two LMI Technologies Gocator-2342-3B-12 line-laser systems, which have the capability of measuring longitudinal texture. As received, internal testing conducted by the FDOT had shown poor agreement between line-laser MPD and accepted reference values on both flexible and rigid pavement. Since then, a research-based approach in configuring the line-laser system to accurately assess pavement macrotexture has been completed. Results from the statewide testing showed that the updated line-laser system produced MPD values on flexible pavement with an average difference of ±5.2% when compared with the point-laser system. On rigid pavement, the updated line-laser system produced MPD values with an average difference of ±10.4% when compared with those produced by a circular track meter. Precision testing showed that the line-laser system produced repeatable results on all pavement types with an average repeatability limit, r, of 0.25 mm and reproducibility limit, R, of 0.30 mm, which was comparable to the precision results of the point-laser system."

Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease process that requires management from multiple health care providers including physicians, nurses, and physical therapists. However, the paucity of information regarding comprehensive physical therapist management for patients with osteoporosis indicated the need for an evidence-based document. The purpose of this document was to provide the best available expert guidance for clinicians in the selection of screening tools, essential tests and measures, treatment goals, and interventions for patients with osteoporosis.
METHODS: A Delphi process was used. Thirty-one physical therapists with expertise in the care of patients with osteoporosis participated in a series of 3 sequential surveys designed to build and reach agreement on the management of patients with osteoporosis. The desired survey outcomes were to: (1) identify the range of examination and plan of care components considered important to physical therapists' care for patients with osteoporosis, (2) determine which components should be considered essential, and (3) achieve consensus on the final list of essential components and related operational definitions.
RESULTS: A clear consensus on the essential components of examination and interventions was achieved. In general, there were 4 to 6 items across each category of history, tests and measures, education/goals, and treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prioritization of these management items will better support clinicians working with adults who have osteoporosis."

Videos evoke temporally synchronized brain responses that are similar across subjects as well as within subjects, but the reproducibility of these brain responses across different data acquisition sites has not yet been quantified. Here, we characterize the consistency of brain responses across independent samples of participants viewing the same videos in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanners at different sites (Indiana University and Caltech). We compared brain responses collected at these different sites for two carefully matched datasets with identical scanner models, acquisition, and preprocessing details, along with a third unmatched dataset in which these details varied. Our overall conclusion is that for matched and unmatched datasets alike, video-evoked brain responses have high consistency across these different sites, both when compared across groups and across pairs of individuals. As one might expect, differences between sites were larger for unmatched datasets than matched datasets. Residual differences between datasets could in part reflect participant-level variability rather than scanner- or data- related effects. Altogether our results indicate promise for the development and, critically, generalization of video fMRI studies of individual differences in healthy and clinical populations alike."

This paper aims at investigating the cracking behavior of lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) beams reinforced with glass- and basalt-FRP (GFRP and BFRP) bars and evaluating the bond-dependent coefficient (kb ) values. Fifteen reinforced concrete specimens 200 mm in width, 300 mm in height, and 3100 mm in length were prepared and tested up to failure. Twelve specimens were made using LWSCC, while the other three were made with normal-weight concrete (NWC) as reference specimens. The test variables were concrete density (LWSCC and NWC); reinforcement type (GFRP and BFRP bars) with various surface conditions (sand-coated and helically grooved); and longitudinal reinforcement ratio. The experimental results show that the FRP-reinforced LWSCC (FRP-LWSCC) beams exhibited cracking behavior similar to that of the counterpart FRP-reinforced NWC (FRP-NWC) beams. The FRP-LWSCC beams had a linear crack response up to failure by concrete crushing, regardless of the amount and surface condition of the FRP reinforcement. Moreover, the recorded crack widths of the FRP-LWSCC beams are presented and compared to those predicted according to FRP design provisions. The comparisons indicate that the crack widths of the FRP-LWSCC beams can be estimated with the FRP design provisions with a variable degree of conservativeness. Furthermore, the determination of the kb factor reveals that the sand-coated GFRP and BFRP bars yielded smaller kb values than the helically grooved GFRP and BFRP bars."

Computational approaches have overcome the limitations of the experimental methods and have performed well in identifying miRNAs. Compared to mature miRNAs, precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are long and have a hairpin loop structure with structural features. Therefore, most in-silico tools are implemented for pre-miRNA identification. This study presents a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based classifier implemented using 180 features under sequential, structural, and thermodynamic feature categories for plant pre-miRNA identification.

In many birds, young individuals remain dependent on their parents for extended periods but must abruptly transition to navigating interactions in the wider group after independence. While lack of social relationships during this period is detrimental in the development of later social skills, little is known about the social relationships juveniles form after independence in many bird species. In this study, we describe patterns of social interactions in juvenile Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) during transitions from family groups into flocks of unfamiliar individuals. Twenty juveniles from four families were introduced into two flocks. After introductions, juveniles showed a gradient of approach rates with most approaches directed toward siblings, followed by juvenile peers, adult females, and lastly adult males. Significant preferences for siblings resulted in the emergence of sibling subgroups within the larger social network. This intentional self-assortment of siblings suggests that sibling subgroups are an important bridge linking social connections within the family and the wider group. Such findings suggests that sibling relationships have a critical role in the socialization after independence, as well as structuring the social organization of Gouldian finch flocks."

However, no study to date has examined the relationship between the KAS and potential changes in hospital length of stay (LOS). This study aimed to examine the relationship between the KAS implemented in December 2014 and potential changes in hospital LOS.
Methods: We used data from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration on kidney transplant surgeries completed between 2011 and 2018. A cross-sectional cohort study design included seven hospitals that performed kidney transplants for the duration of the study. A propensity score matching approach was used to examine the relationship between KAS and LOS. All acute general medical and surgical hospitals in Florida that performed kidney transplant surgery were included in the analysis.
Results: We included 7,795 patients, 6,119 discharged to home, and 1,676 discharged to home with home health services after transplant. The average LOS prior to KAS was 6.52 days and 6.08 days post KAS. Propensity matched results show that patients transferred to home experienced a decrease in the LOS (coefficient (β) = -0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.95, -0.42) after the new allocation score was implemented.

Conclusion: In conclusion, results indicate that KAS implementation did not add a burden on the health system by increasing LOS when considering patients with similar characteristics before and after KAS implementation. KAS is an important policy change that appears to not negatively affect the LOS when sicker patients could receive a kidney transplant.

Study One introduces a novel use of the lexical decision task (LDT) to prime critical words. Participants see two letter-strings and make timed responses indicating whether they are both words. The word pairs Night-Bed and Dream-Thweeb both prime ""sleep"" but only one pair contains two words. Our primary purpose is to introduce this new methodology <i>via</i> two pilot experiments. The results, considered preliminary, are promising as they indicate that participants were as likely to recognize critical words (false memories) and presented words (true memories) just as when studying thematic lists. Study Two actually employs the standard DRM lists so that semantic priming is in play there as well. The second study, however, uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure activity in the prefrontal cortex during a DRM task which includes a deception phase where participants intentionally lie about critical lures. False and true memories occurred at high levels and activated many of the same brain regions but, compared to true memories, cortical activity was higher for false memories and lies. Accuracy findings are accompanied by confidence and reaction time results. Both investigations suggest that it is difficult to distinguish accurate from inaccurate memories. We explain results in terms of activation-monitoring theory and Fuzzy Trace Theory. We provide real world implications and suggest extending the present research to varying age groups and special populations. A nagging question has not been satisfactorily answered: Could neural pathways exist that signal the presence of false memories and lies? Answering this question will require imaging experiments that focus on regions of distinction such as the anterior prefrontal cortex."

Thus, a nonconservative measured strength likely results since most flaws on the surface or in the bulk are not subjected to a sufficiently high tensile stress that can cause fracture. To mitigate this, a rotational flexural tester and corresponding test method were developed whereby rotation and monotonically increasing three‐point flexure were superimposed to investigate fracture response of solid glass cylinders. This combination of rotation and flexure subjects more area and volume of a cylindrical test specimen to tensile stress than a standard static (nonrotating) flexural test. As anticipated, failure stresses were lower for the rotational flexural test. Expressions for effective area and volume are provided for rotating solid rods and tubes subjected to three‐point, four‐point, uniform, and uniformly distributed load bending configurations."

The results of structural equation modeling indicate that value-expressive and social adjustive attitudes were positively correlated with extra-role behavior. Value-expressive, utilitarian, and knowledge showed a significantly positive effect on emotional attachment. Furthermore, emotional attachment and extra-role behavior played a significant mediator role in explaining the relationships between functional attitudes and volunteer engagement.

Focusing on greed restraint at the crime’s payoff point (i.e., not taking everything one could when rewards are seized), we identify the decision-making constructs and conceptual pathways by which this happens and discuss their implications for improved specification of the relationship between criminal propensity, self-regulation, and risk sensitivity. We contend that self-centeredness is the one dimension of criminal propensity that is sufficiently receptive to risk sensitivity to make self-regulation possible, and that individuals with low trait self-control can show state self-control when ambiguity aversion and reference point expectations align to sate anomic greed. This refinement offers novel pathways for future study of dual-influence models of crime, and suggests that offender decision-making is best conceptualized as a process that unfolds during crimes rather than a discrete event that precedes them."

In these metrics, higher nutritional quality carbohydrate foods are defined as those with >10% fiber and <10% free sugar per 100 g carbohydrate. Although fiber- and sugar-based metrics may help to differentiate the nutritional quality of various types of grain products, they may not aptly capture the nutritional quality of other healthy carbohydrate foods, including beans, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. Carbohydrate food quality metrics need to be applicable across these diverse food groups. This report introduces a new carbohydrate food scoring system known as a Carbohydrate Food Quality Score (CFQS), which supplements the fiber and free sugar components of previous metrics with additional dietary components of public health concern (e.g., sodium, potassium, and whole grains) as identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Two CFQS models are developed and tested in this study: one that includes four dietary components (CFQS-4: fiber, free sugars, sodium, potassium) and one that considers five dietary components (CFQS-5: fiber, free sugars, sodium, potassium, and whole grains). These models are applied to 2596 carbohydrate foods in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) 2017−2018. Consistent with past studies, the new carbohydrate food scoring system places large percentages of beans, vegetables, and fruits among the top scoring carbohydrate foods. The whole grain component, which only applies to grain foods (N = 1561), identifies ready-to-eat cereals, oatmeal, other cooked cereals, and selected whole grain breads and crackers as higher-quality carbohydrate foods. The new carbohydrate food scoring system shows a high correlation with the Nutrient Rich Food (NRF9.3) index and the Nutri-Score. Metrics of carbohydrate food quality that incorporate whole grains, potassium, and sodium, in addition to sugar and fiber, are strategically aligned with multiple 2020−2025 dietary recommendations and may therefore help with the implementation of present and future dietary guidelines."

The combination of ultraviolet (UV) light, temperature, and moisture can produce weak spots and lead to pipe degradation during the storage, installation, and repair process. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the chemical, morphological structure, and thermomechanical properties of recycled and virgin pipes under UV exposure. Laboratory accelerated aging tests were conducted by exposing pipes to UV for 3600 h with an irradiance of 0.89 W/(m2 nm) at a wavelength of 340 nm. A cycle of 12 h—comprised of 8 h of UV radiation at 60 °C and 4 h of no UV radiation at 50 °C corresponding to no water condensation—was performed to condition the specimens. HDPE specimens were taken out after 3600 h and analyzed with FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), oxidative-induction time (OIT) measurements, and tensile tests. The results show that the recycled pipes maintained good properties and were not significantly affected by UV radiation, similarly to the virgin pipes. Statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that there was no significant difference between tensile strength, elastic modulus, and hardness measurements before and after UV exposure. There were only a few small changes in the surface of the pipes. The addition of carbon black, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers prevented further aging of the pipes during UV exposure."

The aim of the study was to review interventions conducted in China to optimize use of antibiotics in humans, animals, and the environment from a One Health perspective.
Methods: The literature review for this study was limited to English and Chinese articles published from January 1985 to May 2021. Literature review searches were conducted using Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and three biomedical databases from China (the Chinese Scientific Journals database, the Wanfang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). We used Arksey and O'Malley's step-wise methodological framework as the basis for our scoping review.
Results: A total of 53 studies met our inclusion criteria, of which 51 (96%) were from human healthcare settings, one from environment health that pertained to rural ponds, and no studies were found that met our criteria on interventions used to improve antibiotic use in animals. For human health, the majority of the research was related to antibiotic intervention programs performed in public institutions, and only one policy assessment study included private institutions. Interventions were classified into four broad categories: 1) Knowledge interventions; 2) decision support; 3) financial incentives; and 4) organizational/management systems. Our findings indicated that combinations of multiple interventions were more effective in promoting the rational use of antibiotics in China.
Conclusions: China has made major efforts on improving rational use of antibiotics in the past decades. Most policies or interventions, however, focused mainly on the human health aspect, less effort targeted toward the environment and animal health sectors. For further optimizing use of antibiotics, the cross-disciplinary and coordinated multi-faceted interventions guided by the One Health perspective should be developed and implemented. Meanwhile, the cross-departmental collaborative mechanism leading by the Chinese central government should be further strengthened to play a greater and more active role in fighting against antibiotic resistance wholly."

This paper provides nuance to this research by exploring how stakeholders understand and respond to supergentrification. During the fall of 2016, a group of citizen activists in the exclusive community of Aspen, Colorado, initiated an ordinance seeking to limit the expansion of luxury chain stores. Drawing on qualitative data related to this case, we show that how communities respond to supergentrification depends on locally specific understandings of place and social class, and how class interests have been institutionalized in local policies. In Aspen, residents opposed luxury chain stores by marshaling narratives that foreground the community's history of class mixing and the significance of working locals. Elected officials responded by taking account of the political power of local residents as well as the city's dependence on tax revenues from affluent visitors and second homeowners. Our findings extend and complicate understandings of how power works in elite places, highlighting both the potential for, and limitations of, efforts to thwart supergentrification and associated dislocation."

Cumulative research in the past decades has advanced our understanding of the dynamics of seizure risk. Technological advances have recently made it possible to record pertinent biological signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), continuously. We aimed to assess whether patient-specific seizure forecasting is possible using remote, minimally invasive ultra-long-term subcutaneous EEG.
METHODS: We analyzed a two-center cohort of ultra-long-term subcutaneous EEG recordings, including six patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy monitored for 46-230 days with median 18 h/day of recorded data, totaling >11 000 h of EEG. Total electrographic seizures identified by visual review ranged from 12 to 36 per patient. Three candidate subject-specific long short-term memory network deep learning classifiers were trained offline and pseudoprospectively on preictal (1 h before) and interictal (>1 day from seizures) EEG segments. Performance was assessed relative to a random predictor. Periodicity of the final forecasts was also investigated with autocorrelation.
RESULTS: Depending on each architecture, significant forecasting performance was achieved in three to five of six patients, with overall mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of .65-.74. Significant forecasts showed sensitivity ranging from 64% to 80% and time in warning from 10.9% to 44.4%. Overall, the output of the forecasts closely followed patient-specific circadian patterns of seizure occurrence.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates proof-of-principle for the possibility of subject-specific seizure forecasting using a minimally invasive subcutaneous EEG device capable of ultra-long-term at-home recordings. These results are encouraging for the development of a prospective seizure forecasting trial with minimally invasive EEG."

Hypothesis: Level of PA participation will modify mortality risk across a spectrum of HDL-C levels.   Methods: The study sample (n=8,535) included participants (age 20-79 years) from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PA was classified into three distinct categories: Those meeting neither of the PA guidelines (category 1), those meeting only the aerobic PA guideline (category 2), and those meeting both the aerobic PA and muscular strengthening activity guidelines (category 3). HDL-C was categorized into eight groups (≤30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60 [referent group], 61-70, 70-80, and >80 mg/dL). All-cause mortality served as the dependent variable in this study. Cox proportional hazard models were used for all analyses.   Results: Among those in PA category 1, a statistically significant increase in all-cause mortality risk was found for those with an HDL-C of 71-80 (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.14-3.32) and >80 mg/dL (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.25-3.79). In those with an HDL-C <30 mg/dL, a borderline significant increase in all-cause mortality risk was found (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.96-2.89, p=0.06) Among those in PA categories 2 and 3, no significant increases in all-cause mortality risk were found.   Conclusions: Results suggest that meeting at least the aerobic PA guideline mitigates the increased risk for all-cause mortality in those with very high HDL-C and potentially very low HDL-C. Future studies are warranted to investigate the effects of PA on mortality across measures of HDL-C. "

It explores the characteristic factors of identifying problematic platforms, and designs a P2P platform risk early warning model.   Design/methodology/approach With the help of web crawler software, this paper crawls the information of 1427 P2P platforms from the two largest third-party lending information platforms (i.e. P2Peye and WDZJ) in China. SPSS 22.0 was mainly used for basic descriptive statistical analysis, reliability and validity analysis, and regression analysis of the data. MPLUS 7.0 was used for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models analysis.   Findings Based on the multi-dimensional information, this paper performs text mining to develop an investor sentiment index. This study shows that the characteristics of the platform (i.e. basic features, capital security, operations management, and social network) have a significant impact on identifying problematic platforms.   Research limitations/implications There are some limitations to this research. In the process of model construction, some external factors may be ignored, such as government policies. Future research will need to consider the impact of policy and other factors more comprehensively on P2P lending platform risk identification.   Practical implications This study proposes an effective method for investors and regulators to identify the risk factors of P2P lending platforms. The research findings provide valuable insights for promoting government participation in platform management as well as a healthy development of the P2P lending industry.   Originality/value The paper addresses the factors that influence platform risks to help analyze P2P lending platforms. Prior research has not explored how to identify problematic P2P lending platforms in-depth and is limited by only focusing on either soft information or hard information. It identifies the characteristic factors of identifying problematic platforms and designs a P2P platform risk early warning model. "

The historic reliance of undocumented migrant Latino laborers continues to influence the modern-day work conditions Latinos face such as low wages, limited benefits, and an emphasis on productivity over safety, which also increases their risk for adverse health outcomes.
Objective: This narrative review aims to describe and highlight key risk factors on the impact of systemic racism and how it shapes the work and occupational health experiences of Latino laborers in the US, as well as strategies to overcome barriers.
Method: In this review, we explore empirical studies, news reports, and policy briefs that highlight the social factors impacting occupational health outcomes for undocumented Latino migrant laborers and synthesize the information to report major challenges experienced during the pandemic and propose recommendations for improving conditions and occupational health of these groups.
Results: Existing literature demonstrated that (1) documentation status was a barrier to federal relief programs during COVID-19; (2) though categorized as essential workers, workplace conditions were harmful towards preventing infection and transmission of COVID-19; and (3) there was an increased burden particularly for undocumented Latino women both in the workplace and at home during the pandemic. Recommendations include prioritization of undocumented immigrants in government relief, and addressing both individual and environmental level stressors in the workplace to promote inclusivity and reduce unnecessary suffering of Latino migrant workers.
Conclusion: Latino laborers should be treated with dignity and respect with workplace protections as they are designated as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The present mixed-method study examined early care and education (ECE) teachers' working conditions and physical, psychological, and professional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic using a national sample of 1434 ECE teachers in the U.S. We also explored differences in working conditions and well-being among in-person, online, and closed schools, given the unique challenges and risks that ECE teachers may have faced by teaching in these different modalities. From the results of an online survey, we found that in the early months of the pandemic, many ECE teachers faced stressful, challenging work environments. Some were teaching in new, foreign modes and formats, and those still teaching in person faced new challenges. We found many common issues and challenges related to psychological and physical well-being across the three teaching groups from the qualitative analysis, but a more complicated picture emerged from the quantitative analysis. After controlling for education and center type, we found that aspects of professional commitment were lower among those teachers teaching in person. Additionally, there were racial differences across several of our measures of well-being for teachers whose centers were closed. Upon closer examination of these findings via a moderation analysis with teacher modality, we found that Black and Hispanic teachers had higher levels of psychological well-being for some of our indicators when their centers were closed, yet these benefits were not present for Black and Hispanic teachers teaching in person."

Data from six patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy and monitored with an sqEEG device were used to develop a generalized algorithm for seizure forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning classifiers. Electrographic seizures were identified by a board-certified epileptologist. One-minute data segments were labeled as preictal or interictal based on their relationship to confirmed seizures. Data were separated into training and testing data sets, and to compensate for the unbalanced data ratio in training, noise-added copies of preictal data segments were generated to expand the training data set. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the training data were used to normalize all data, preserving the pseudo-prospective nature of the analysis. Different architecture classifiers were trained and tested using a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation method, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance classifiers. The importance of each input signal was evaluated using a leave-one-signal-out method with repeated training and testing for each classifier. Cross-patient classifiers achieved performance significantly better than chance in four of the six patients and an overall mean AUC of 0.602 ± 0.126 (mean ± SD). A time in warning of 37.386% ± 5.006% (mean ± std) and sensitivity of 0.691 ± 0.068 (mean ± std) were observed for patients with better than chance results. Analysis of input channels showed a significant contribution (p < .05) by the Fourier transform of signals channels to overall classifier performance. The relative contribution of input signals varied among patients and architectures, suggesting that the inclusion of all signals contributes to robustness in a cross-patient classifier. These early results show that it is possible to forecast seizures training with data from different patients using two-channel ultra-long-term sqEEG."

In doing so, they have often sought places that are homogeneous in terms class, and often race/ethnicity, and sought to preserve elite enclaves through a variety of policies and practices. But as we detail here, affluent people are now drawn to different types of residential settings, and their presence influences these places in sometimes surprising ways. In this essay, we review both exclusionary forms of affluent placemaking and more complex and varied forms emerging in gentrifying and super‐gentrifying places. There, the strategies that affluent residents use to create and preserve places have become more varied, as have the relationships between place and class status. These more nuanced understandings of class and place reflects scholars' heightened interest in the cultural dimensions of social class, intersections of race and class, and attention to the ways in which class and affluence reflect and influence the political context."

The role of glucocorticoid receptor signaling and REDD1 protein in mediating gene expression was assessed in exercised mice. Changes to expression of glucocorticoid genes were greater when exercise occurred in the dark cycle. REDD1 was required for the induction of genes induced at both times of day.

While Hg contamination has lessened in this region, it is still critical to monitor Hg uptake and potential risks in south Florida wildlife, especially in marine-associated birds, which are known to accumulate potentially toxic Hg levels. In this study, total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in liver, kidney, muscle, and feathers of 101 individuals from seven species of south Florida birds: brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis, double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auratus, herring gull Larus argentatus, laughing gull Leucophaeus atricilla, northern gannet Morus bassanus, royal tern Thalasseus maximus, and osprey Pandion halietus. A sizeable proportion of individuals (> 40%) were found to contain THg concentrations in internal tissues that exceeded estimated toxicity thresholds for Hg-related effects. Certain species, especially osprey, were found to exhibit a higher rate of threshold exceedances than others and should continue to be monitored for Hg-related effects in future studies. Feather THg concentrations exhibited a lower rate of toxicity threshold exceedances (12%) and were not significantly correlated with those in internal tissues in most cases, suggesting that they may not be well suited for monitoring Hg exposure in these species unless sources of data variation can be better understood. The results of the present study contribute significantly to our understanding of trends in Hg accumulation and Hg-related health risks in south Florida marine-associated birds."

The find is examined in detail, in comparison to other large cone shell groups from Mycenaean contexts. The facts suggest that the Θ3 assemblage artefacts could have been markers for a kind of game, for which games of strategy, skill and chance known in the Eastern Mediterranean, are suggested as possible candidates. Under this hypothesis, context finds from the Room Θ3 deposit are also examined.

However, the existing rural e-commerce models are far from enough to reach potential customers and satisfy their heterogeneous needs. To fully leverage the advantages of e-commerce, the rural economy needs innovative business models to sustain its growth. Some rural Internet celebrities, such as Li Ziqi in China, have recognized the values of short videos and used them as a creative entrepreneurial model to promote and sell their products to customers in rural areas. This paper applies the reverse engineering method to study and generalize Li Ziqi’s entrepreneurial process in rural e-commerce based on the information adoption model and attention mechanism. We find that Li Ziqi’s short videos promote rural e-commerce by attracting consumers’ attention through the associated distinctive cultural knowledge. The unique, heterogeneous knowledge of products can boost rural e-commerce via short videos as the intermediaries. Short videos’ attention mechanism facilitates the development of new business models driven by business influences for rural e-commerce.

Design/methodology/approach  This paper uses logistic regression and identifies restatements between 2004 and 2016. Following prior research, (Dao et al. , 2012; Francis and Michas, 2013; Francis et al. , 2013; Lennox and Li, 2014; Lobo and Zhao, 2013; Paterson and Valencia, 2011), this study allows time between the end of our sample period and the date that this study obtained the restatement data because it takes time for material misstatements to be identified.    Findings  Bryan et al. (2018) report a negative association between autocorrelation and audit fees, suggesting that auditors view lower autocorrelation as increasing inherent risk. This study finds that autocorrelation is negatively related to accounting restatements, implying that although auditors react to lower autocorrelation by increasing their risk assessments (Bryan et al. , 2018), their risk response is not sufficient. This study finds that autocorrelation has a fairly large effect: a shift from the 75th to the 25th percentile of autocorrelation is associated with a 9.38% increase in the likelihood of a restatement.    Originality/value  This study contributes to the stream of research that investigates the determinants of restatements. Not only do this study identifies autocorrelation as a factor that contributes to restatements, but importantly, this study’s results reveal a fairly substantial effect size: a shift from the 75th to the 25th percentile of autocorrelation is associated with a 9.38% increase in the likelihood of a restatement.

Gender diversity can make a difference," Purpose Using the attention-based view, this paper aims to examine whether and how board composition might influence the allocation of board attention to corporate sustainability.   Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper that uses a theoretical perspective pointing to the importance of generating a board composition that might benefit both business case framing and paradoxical framing, a typology introduced in managerial cognition literature to explain managerial decision-making.   Findings The conclusions emerging from the reviewed literature suggest that boards that have realized an independence of perspective focus on shareholder profit maximization at the expense of considerations of corporate sustainability. It emerges that women directors who have adopted paradoxical framing can enable boards to consider not only economic but also environmental and social issues of sustainability during board decision-making. Further, it is noted that the effect of gender diversity on allocation of board attention to corporate sustainability is contingent upon contextual (board openness) and structural (chairperson leadership) factors that facilitate social interactions inside boardrooms.   Originality/value By considering alternative cognitive frames as well as social interactions, the propositions contribute to a better understanding of the allocation of board attention regarding ambiguous sustainability issues.

MuRF1 is a recognized marker of muscle atrophy and we have recently identified Fbxl22 to be involved in the process of denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. Thus, we sought to investigate the role of MuRF1 and Fbxl22 together in the process of skeletal muscle atrophy. Male C57BL/6 mice (16 to 20‐week old) were subjected to in vivo electroporation with either a mouse specific MuRF1 or Fbxl22 plasmid (20ug) in the gastrocnemius (GA) muscles with the contralateral leg serving as a vector control (EV). An additional cohort of mice was electroporated with MuRF1 and Fbxl22 plasmids simultaneously. After 7 days, lateral (LGA) and medial (MGA) gastrocnemius muscles were collected, weighed and sectioned for cross‐sectional area (CSA) and GFP visualization. Western blotting was performed on sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar fractions to determine levels of ubiquitin and sarcomeric proteins in the transfected GA muscles. MuRF1 overexpression (OE) resulted in significant loss of total GA muscle mass (‐8.8%) after 7 days alone. In comparison, Fbxl22 OE led to no loss in total GA muscle mass, although significant reductions in LGA mass (‐3.4%) were observed. Combined OE of MuRF1 and Fbxl22 together resulted in significant loss of GA muscle mass (‐5.5%) but the level of atrophy was not as great as compared to MuRF1 OE alone. In transfected LGA muscles, total ubiquitin levels were significantly elevated in the Fbxl22 OE and combined E3 ligase group for the sarcoplasmic fraction. In the myofibrillar fraction of LGA transfected muscles, only the combined E3 ligase group displayed increased total ubiquitin levels after 7 days. In transfected Fbxl22 LGA muscles, we observed significant increases in vimentin, alpha‐actinin and Troponin T in the sarcoplasmic fractions. Gene manipulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and Fbxl22 in basal skeletal muscle resulted in skeletal muscle atrophy and divergent changes in ubiquitination and sarcomeric proteins were observed following E3 overexpression. Future studies will seek to identify potential unique and shared substrates targeted by Fbxl22 and MuRF1 for ubiquitination."

The gene expression profile in the denervated muscle tissue was then analyzed by microarray and compared to control muscle tissue to identify novel neurogenic atrophy‐induced genes. The microarray data revealed for the first time that TSSK6 Activating Co‐chaperone (TSACC) is expressed in skeletal muscle and is significantly induced in response to denervation.

Select microbes can interact synergistically with pathobionts to induce virulence traits, modify environmental niches, and modulate host responses. In the setting of Clostridioides difficile infection, polymicrobial interactions are incompletely understood. C. difficile is an intestinal pathogen responsible for 500,000 infections and 30,000 deaths annually in the US. Using stool‐seeded bioreactors with mucus‐coated inserts, we identified Klebsiella pneumoniae in the mucus‐associated microbiota along with C. difficile. We hypothesized that K. pneumoniaemay enhance C. difficile traits required for colonization. To test this hypothesis, we cultured 11 K. pneumoniae strains with four C. difficile strains (representing 4 different ribotypes) in a fully defined bacteria media ZMB1. We observed that cell‐free supernatant from all K. pneumoniae strains enhanced the growth of all C. difficile strains, indicating that metabolites produced by K. pneumoniae enhanced C. difficile growth. Importantly, C. difficile grew well with K. pneumoniae bacteria and both bacteria were identified in co‐cultures by gram staining. Non‐targeted metabolomics revealed that K. pneumoniae shifted the metabolism of C. difficile away from amino acid utilization. K. pneumoniae metabolites also suppressed toxin production in an in vitro model of nutrient starvation as assessed by live‐imaging of LifeAct expressing Vero cell rounding. These findings further confirm the ability of K. pneumoniae to cross‐feed C. difficile. Although K. pneumoniae is well known for robust biofilm production, K. pneumoniae did not significantly enhance C. difficile biofilm formation, indicating that biofilm synthesis is not a significant component of C. difficile‐Klebsiella interactions. RNA sequencing of mouse colonic inside‐out organoids incubated with live C. difficile and/or K. pneumoniae revealed increased pro‐inflammatory responses when the two microbes were added together compared to either microbe alone or media controls. These results suggest that K. pneumoniae can cross‐feed and shift the metabolism of C. difficile, as well as enhance the pro‐inflammatory capacity of C. difficile. We speculate that interspecies interactions could be among the earliest events that occur as C. difficile colonizes the host. As a result, we believe that an improved understanding of how mucus associated microbes like K. pneumoniae interact with C. difficile will continue to clarify the mechanisms of C. difficile infection."
pub.1147555042,ur.01172566245.01,UNF,"Ellis, Terri",Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,Klebsiella pneumoniae utilizes intestinal mucus to increase fitness in the gastrointestinal tract,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a growing concern in the healthcare setting, as carbapenem‐resistant Enterobacteriaceae are considered an urgent health threat by the Center of Disease Control (CDC). K. pneumoniae is found in the mucosa of the human gastrointestinal tract, but upon intestinal disruption K. pneumoniae can migrate into the blood stream and cause infection. One of the barriers against bacterial translocation is the intestinal mucus layer. Mucus proteins are covered with branching glycans which can serve as a fuel source for microbes that harbor mucus‐specific glycosyl hydrolases. We hypothesized that K. pneumoniae could degrade and utilize mucus as an energy source to increase its fitness in the GI tract. Using the Carbohydrate‐Active enZYme Database (CAZY), we identified that 274 K. pneumoniae genomes harbored at least 3 mucin‐degrading glycosyl hydrolase families. To confirm the ability of K. pneumoniae to degrade mucus, we grew five commercially available K. pneumoniae strains and six clinical isolates of K. pneumoniaein a chemically defined minimal media (CDMM) lacking glucose supplemented with mucin‐associated oligosaccharides or dialyzed porcine intestinal MUC2 mucus. All K. pneumoniae strains grew well is sialic acid, GalNAc, fucose and galactose. Interestingly, K. pneumoniae strains exhibited robust growth during log phase with glucose, but were unable to sustain long term growth. Surprisingly, some clinical isolates showed similar growth with GluNAC as with glucose, while other strains could not utilize GluNAC as an energy source. All but one strain of K. pneumoniae could grow with dialyzed mucus as the sole carbon source, indicating that K. pneumoniae can enzymatically degrade mucus and utilize the liberated sugars for growth. To determine how mucus influenced the pathogenesis of K. pneumoniae, we grew one commercially available and one clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae in CDMM with fucose or mucus, isolated the RNA and examined the expression of genes associated with K. pneumoniae virulence by qPCR. We examined virulence factors related to iron uptake (iroD), nucleic acid metabolism (allS), endotoxin production (clbA), fatty acid biosynthesis (clbB), type 1‐ fimbriae (fimH), and flagella (fliC). Both K. pneumoniae strains had increased iroD expression in the presence of mucus. Interestingly, we observed that the clinical isolate, but not the commercially available strain of K. pneumoniae had increased expression of virulence genes clbB, allS and fliC when grown with mucus when compared to being grown with fucose. K. pneumoniae is traditionally considered a nonmotile bacterium, however, we confirmed the expression of flagella in our clinical isolate by performing a chemotaxis assay using mucus‐associated sugars and mucus. We indeed saw that our commercially available strain was unable to migrate towards the mucus or mucus‐associated sugars. However, our clinical isolate was able to swim towards mucus‐associated sugars. These results suggest that K. pneumoniae utilizes intestinal mucus as an energy source in the GI tract, which in turn influences the pathogenicity of clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae."

There is evidence that glucocorticoids induce transcriptional changes in the skeletal muscle in response to a bout of aerobic exercise, but the extent of these changes and whether time of day exercise affects the glucocorticoid transcriptional response is unknown. The purpose of this study was to define changes to the skeletal muscle glucocorticoid transcriptome in response to acute aerobic exercise at different times of day. A secondary purpose was to define the role of Regulated in Development and DNA Damage 1 (REDD1) in mediating these changes as REDD1 is not only a transcriptional target of the glucocorticoid receptor, but it can also modulate glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. A list of glucocorticoid target genes whose expression is altered in the skeletal muscle at various times of day in response to acute exercise was generated by comparing published genomic data sets from rodents subjected to acute aerobic exercise in the light or dark cycles to published genomic data sets from C2C12 myotubes treated with Dexamethasone. The role of glucocorticoid receptor signaling to the genomic changes was assessed in exercised mice treated with RU‐486. The role of REDD1 in mediating the changes to the glucocorticoid transcriptome was assessed in mice lacking REDD1. Glucocorticoids modulated expression of numerous genes in the skeletal muscle in response to acute aerobic exercise in the light and dark cycles, including those that are a target of, or contribute to, ubiquitin conjugation. The extent of changes to the glucocorticoid transcriptome was greater when exercise was conducted in the dark cycle compared to the light cycle. Only some genes encoding proteins involved in ubiquitin conjugation were induced by exercise at both times of day. REDD1 is required for the induction of these genes, whereas those only induced in the light cycle did not require REDD1. The time of day at which aerobic exercise is conducted dictates the extent of changes to the glucocorticoid transcriptome in skeletal muscle. REDD1 is a transducer mediating the time‐of‐day changes to the glucocorticoid transcriptome in skeletal muscle."

The microarray revealed that Calcium Binding and Coiled Coil Domain 1 (Calcoco1) is expressed in skeletal muscle and induced in response to denervation. To confirm that Calcoco1 is expressed in skeletal muscle, the cDNA was successfully amplified and cloned from cultured C2C12 cells. Moreover, quantitative PCR was conducted using RNA isolated from proliferating and differentiated muscle cells to determine the expression profile of Calcoco1 at the transcriptional level. We observed moderate activation of Calcoco1 through myoblast proliferation and early differentiation, followed by a robust increase in activation by the later stages of myotube differentiation. These results were mirrored at the protein level where it was observed that Calcoco1 is expressed during early proliferation and increases as muscle cell differentiation progresses. To elucidate a functional role for Calcoco1 in muscle, we transfected cultured muscle cells with a Calcoco1 expression plasmid and then harvested the cells at timepoints ranging from proliferation through late differentiation. The cell lysates were probed by Western blot for markers of muscle cell differentiation, including Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC) and myogenin, which both show significant repression in response to Calcoco1 overexpression.

Nigella sativa (N.sativa) is a widely used medicinal plant known for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hepato-protective properties. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementation of N. sativa oil on plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin, and blood pressure (BP) in patients diagnosed with NAFLD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 44 NAFLD patients. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 22/group); the experimental group received 1000 mg of N. sativa oil per day, while the control group received a placebo for eight weeks. The primary outcome measures were serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured at the baseline and the end of the intervention.
RESULTS: After eight weeks of supplementation with N. sativa oil, no statistically significant differences were found in serum levels of adiponectin (p = 0.40), leptin (p = 0.89), systolic BP (p = 0.13), and diastolic BP (p = 0.09) between the two groups. Furthermore, after supplementation with N. sativa, no significant changes were observed in leptin (p = 0.07), adiponectin (p = 0.13), systolic BP (p = 0.82), and diastolic BP (p = 0.38) within the two groups.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that administration of N. sativa oil 1000 mg/day for 8 weeks has no favorable effect on cardiometabolic measures in NAFLD patients. Further studies with higher dosage over a longer period are needed to investigate whether this effect is dose- and time-dependent."

The authors draw from diffusion theory and marketplace omission and commission to situate the research focus and highlight its application to the study findings.   Design/methodology/approach  A content analysis was conducted on 481 cover models on the top three fashion magazines of 2018 – Vogue , Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair during 2006–2018.    Findings The findings indicate WOC are underrepresented despite the strides of inclusion in the marketplace in America during a postracial period. Representation is as follows: white – 412 (86%); black – 41 (9%); Latina – 19 (3.9%); biracial 7 (1.5%); Asian – 1 (0.2%); and Native American – 1 (0.2%). Latina models had the lowest representation. Native and Asian women were completely excluded. When they do appear, black and Latina cover models are more likely than white models to be shown wearing sexually suggestive attire.   Practical implications This study makes four recommendations to promote antiracism in marketing: diversify staff hiring and editorial decision-makers for public-facing talent; solicit counsel from multicultural marketing agencies; create antiracist marketing curriculum; and cultivate a pipeline of diverse talent for future hiring.   Originality/value The originality of this paper centers its contribution to the dearth research investigating representation implications within the fashion marketing industry during an alleged post-racial period, and a longer time span. It also presents structured antiracist marketing solutions to mitigate underrepresentation. "

This study examined the association of diabetes risk status with meeting aerobic activity (AA), muscle strengthening activity (MSA) and both recommendations.
METHODS: Non-pregnant women, 18-44, free of recognized diabetes, who participated in the 2011, 2013, 2015, or 2017 U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (N = 211,114) were categorized as no diabetes (ND; n = 202,766, referent) versus at-risk for diabetes (RD; n = 8348). Logistic regression models generated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), adjusted for demographics and BMI. Tests for multiplicative interactions were performed for BMI category and race and ethnicity.
RESULTS: There were lower odds of meeting AA, MSA and both recommendations in the RD group (referent = ND; OR 0.95 [5% CI 0.78, 0.97], 0.83 [95% CI 0.91, 0.98] and 0.87 [95% CI 0.78, 0.97], respectively). Effect modification by BMI category was detected for models assessing MSA (p = 0.10), both (p = 0.07) and neither recommendation (p = 0.005), but not for AA. Among those with a BMI in the healthy and overweight groups, RD had decreased odds of meeting MSA recommendations (referent = ND; 0.69 [95% CI 0.58, 0.81] and 0.78 [95% CI 0.65, 0.93], respectively); among the healthy BMI, RD had 24% decreased odds of meeting both recommendations (referent = ND; 95% CI 0.63, 0.91). There was no difference in meeting PA recommendations among groups in the obese category, but the increased odds of meeting the AA recommendation among the RD group were approaching significance (referent = ND; [95% CI 1.00, 1.29], p = 0.06].
CONCLUSION: Reproductive-aged women with previous GD or recognized PD stand to benefit from increasing PA, especially MSA, the least often met recommendation."

Supercrip is defined as a stereotypical representation of individuals with disabilities that highlights their accomplishments as inspirational stories of defying or overcoming their disability to succeed. With little consensus on how to represent disability in sport, it is imperative that this representation be investigated. The purpose of this commentary is to broadly examine assumptions of the supercrip model as a mode of representation for athletes with disabilities, explore its connection to able-bodied hegemony, and propose next steps in facilitating research and discourse around representation for athletes with disabilities. We conclude that able-bodied hegemony is the root of the supercrip model and that participatory action research, with stakeholders at the center, is necessary to fully evaluate the supercrip model."

The focus of this study was to configure an LLG7 MRU to accurately and repeatably detect and measure the retroreflectivity of in-service Class B raised pavement markers (RPMs) while simultaneously collecting PM retroreflectivity data. At this time, FDOT assesses the quality of in-service RPMs as part of a visual inspection. Currently, there are no standards or devices for mobile RPM retroreflectivity measurements. As these LLG7 MRUs were designed to measure PMs in units of R L (mcd/m 2 /lux), an additional objective was to derive regression equations that correlate the industry-standard units for RPMs (R I [mcd/lux]) and the R L values collected by the MRU. Through research-based experiments and with coordination from RoadVista, modifications were made to the LLG7 MRU to detect and measure RPM retroreflectivity in relation to R L . Regression equations were derived pertaining to retroreflectivity measurements between a handheld RPM retroreflectometer (R I ) and an LLG7 MRU (R L ) on in-service RPMs. The results indicate that the modified MRU can be used to effectively assess RPM retroreflectivity in tenth-mile intervals in a highly repeatable manner with an average error in estimated R I of ±13.5% without affecting PM data. Overall, utilizing the modified MRU for statewide RPM assessments is a significant improvement from the current process of visual assessments and allows the FDOT to quantify RPM quality on a network level.

Utilizing prospect theory, we argue that the two types of investors face unequal levels of uncertainty and are dissimilarly loss averse due to varying levels of knowledge and access to resources. This results in varying attitudes towards investment horizon, risk-taking, and preference for information sources. We find investor proclivity toward an NPPA depends on several factors, including the short-term abnormal return, the valence of coverage in media and analyst reports, the firm's risk profile, and the exploration emphasis of the firm. Moreover, we show that higher levels of institutional ownership ultimately contribute to new product success. The results hold implications for strategies that managers can employ to increase investor ownership within the firm to fund innovation."

Convenience is surely one reason for this trend, but it is less relevant for in-home consumption of bottled water. The existing literature highlights perceptions of quality, access to information and personal experience as important factors influencing water usage in the home. In this paper we report the results of a 2018 survey of water customers of Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA), the primary municipal water utility in Northeast Florida. The survey includes detailed questions regarding self-reported household water usage, information availability, information processing, trust in institutions and demographic characteristics. In addition, in cooperation with JEA, we matched the survey results with administrative data on geographic location within the system. Using a bivariate probit regression method, we estimate the determinants of water usage in the home. The results show that concern for drinking water safety is the principal contributor of bottled water consumption.

Studying a survey sample collected from 186 entrepreneurial and MSMEs, we discovered a crucial mediating mechanism in the relationship between them: market agility. Our findings suggest that the use of big data analytics enables MSMEs to enhance their market agility, thereby strengthening their innovation adoption. In addition, an MSME’s strong dynamic capability helps boost the effects of market agility on innovation adoption. While early success traps strengthen the effects of market agility on innovation adoption, they weaken the effects on innovation generation.

While focusing on pedestrian-involved crashes that occurred far away from intersections, a more systematic investigation is needed to determine whether there is a relationship between the severity of these crashes and the land use types surrounding the crash locations. To investigate this issue, a network-based logistic regression model was employed to assess the impact of the distance between pedestrian-involved crash locations and the centroid of an associated land use of various types. In addition, a set of logistic models was developed to assess the effect of traffic- and environment-related factors, such as daylight and the average annual daily traffic (AADT), on the severity of crashes occurring around each land use. Several types of land use appeared to be influential in predicting pedestrian-involved crash severity. The probability of a severe pedestrian-involved crash increased around commercial land use types including retail stores or night clubs whereas it decreased around university campuses. Moreover, among the crash attributes, daylight contributed to the severity of pedestrian-involved crashes regardless of the surrounding land use type while average traffic was found to be a statistically significant factor for the crashes that occurred particularly around parking lots and office buildings. Pedestrian-involved crashes mostly occurred in the vicinity of office buildings during daylight hours, and the pedestrians were less likely to be severely injured. The findings provided valuable insight into the measurements concerning pedestrian safety with respect to various types of land use."

A retrospective analysis on the impact of EGCG on puberty onset in obese girls was conducted on plasma samples collected from a human randomized controlled trial. In the trial, participants consumed EGCG capsules for 12 weeks. In the animal experiment, rats were divided into four groups: normal diet control (NC) group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, NC+EGCG group, and HFD+EGCG group. Blood samples were collected on postnatal days 27, 33, and 36 to detect sexual development indicators. The hypothalamic expressions of kisspeptin/Kiss1R and neurokinin B (NKB)/NK3R signaling were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. The ovary NKB protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemical assays. Serum NKB level in the EGCG group was lower than the placebo group by 0.599 ng/mL [β=-0.599, 95% CI: (-1.005, -0.193)], at the end of intervention and after adjusting for confounders (clinical study). In the animal experiment, EGCG intervention could significantly delay the vaginal opening (VO) time of rats fed with HFD. On day 33, EGCG intervention could significantly reduce serum NKB, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, ovarian NKB protein expression, and endometrial thickness of HFD-fed rats, while EGCG intervention could remarkably increase mRNA and protein expression of NKB/NK3R. EGCG could prevent obesity-related precocious puberty through NKB/NK3R signaling pathway, which may provide a novel insight into the role of EGCG in preventing precocious puberty in obese girls."

Risky decision-making was assessed in six daily-life scenarios in a sample of 357 adult participants, ages 18-75. Scenarios differed regarding competition (competitive vs. non-competitive) and presence of others (alone, with friends, or with acquaintances). Additionally, the personality variables ego-strength, agreeableness, and resistance-to-peer influence as well as demographic variables were assessed. Results showed that participants made more risky decisions in the non-competitive scenarios and in the scenarios when they were accompanied by a friend compared to when they were alone. Regression analyses revealed that men made more risky decisions than women. High resistance-to-peer influence and agreeableness whereas related to fewer risky decisions. Overall, results showed the strong influence of social and personality factors on risky decision-making which could have implications for prevention programmes. Further, these results show that a pure cognitive approach to the study of risky decision-making is too narrow. Considering cognition, social context, and personality traits together seems to be a promising approach for the study of risky daily-life decisions."

PSSs are comprised of complex, related products and services; stakeholders; processes; and environments. It is therefore important to identify, integrate, and manage information from different data-sources. This paper introduces the critical issues facing PSSs and provides reference terminology for PSSs in the form of an ontology. This ontology represents a generic PSS that not only adds value to the PSS design but also offers the potential to improve individual products and services in the system. Thus, in this paper, we aim to facilitate communication between stakeholders from different domains and integrate heterogeneous data from various data-sources during the PSS lifecycle. As a result, our paper supports the design and delivery of PSS components by providing a generic PSS ontology for the manufacturing domain, and a glossary of entities, with concrete, unambiguous definitions. The research that led to the development of the proposed generic PSS ontology resulted from the collaboration of several academic and industrial partners in two EU projects: DIVERSITY and FALCON."

(2020) examined the content and linguistic characteristics of public companies' cybersecurity risk disclosure practices as well as factors that may drive disclosure trends. In this paper, we extend Gao et al. (2020) by exploring SEC comment letter practices related to cybersecurity risk disclosures and investigating how SEC comment letters lead to changes in companies’ cybersecurity risk disclosures. Coinciding with newly issued cybersecurity guidelines, SEC comment letters related to cybersecurity disclosure deficiencies spiked in 2011. On average, it takes about 26 days for a registrant to respond to a comment letter and only 10 percent of registrants respond within the recommended 10-day period. Most comment letters (75 percent) are resolved within one round of communication. Multiple rounds of communication are often required when deficiencies surround disclosure of a cyber breach. Though 81 percent of registrants respond to comment letters related to cybersecurity breaches by claiming that there was no need for disclosure as the breaches were not material, the SEC will likely reject that claim and require the registrant to provide the required detail. We find evidence that the SEC uses comment letters to signal that the staff wish to see an explicit statement in the registrant’s cybersecurity risk disclosures on whether or not the firm suffered security breaches during a reporting period. The SEC scrutinizes cybersecurity risk disclosures to verify they are sufficient subsequent to a published security breach. Firms change their disclosure behavior one year after receiving a comment letter. Specifically, the length of cybersecurity risk disclosures increases, specificity increases, and readability and clarity improve one year after a registrant receives a comment letter that points to deficiencies in the firm’s cybersecurity risk disclosures."
pub.1148861856,ur.01302000265.19,UNF,"Hamadi, Hanadi",Health Sciences,The Hospital Value‐Based Purchasing Program: Do hospitalists improve health care value,"INTRODUCTION: As healthcare organizations examine the associated benefits of employing a larger hospitalist workforce, there is a need to better understand the association with patients' quality, experience, and efficiency. However, there is a lack of information regarding how hospital use of hospitalists over time influences hospital scoring on quality programs, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Inpatient Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) Program. This study examines the association between hospitalist staffing between 2014 and 2019 and HVBP scores.
METHODS: We used a cross-sectional panel study design. Total Performance Score (TPS) and its domains were obtained from CMS from 2014 to 2019 and merged with the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database. We utilized random-effects multivariable panel regression models and zero-inflated negative binomial regression to examine the association between the hospitalist-staffing ratio and the HVBP Program. All models were adjusted for hospital characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 2126 hospitals were included in the study. The average ratio of hospitalists per staffed bed was 0.06, with a standard deviation of 0.15. This study suggests that hospitals that employ a higher percentage of hospitalists see improvement in their overall TPS (β = 5.40; p < .001), Patient Experience (β = 2.49; p <.05), and Efficiency (incidence-rate ratio= 1.41; p < .001) domain. However, the Clinical Care domain was no different in organizations employing more hospitalists.
CONCLUSION: There are benefits associated with TPS, Patient Experience, and Efficiency from employing hospitalists. Managers should seek opportunities to leverage hospitalists' expertise in providing care, particularly in improving care processes."

Elementary teachers need more than professional development with innovative content and curriculum to be ready to integrate STEM; they need the agency that comes with a strong sense of who they are and who they want to become as STEM teachers. In this commentary, we propose a model for integrated STEM teacher identity with the goal of building a robust definition that is applicable to multiple educational contexts. The model captures the tensions between elementary teachers’ multiple identities as STEM learners, professional teachers, and STEM education innovators. Our proposed model structures the complexity of these roles as an intertwining of components from extant professional teacher identity and STEM learner identity models. The careful cultivation of integrated STEM identities has the power to increase teachers’ readiness to not only try but to sustain innovative curriculum. Teacher educators and professional development facilitators can use this model to provide more personalized support to teachers. Recommendations for future refinement of this model are offered along with implications for more equitable access to integrated STEM experiences for all students."

One such variable that has a notable impact on memory for faces is viewing distance, with faces encoded from a shorter distance remembered better than faces encoded at longer differences. In four pre-registered experiments, using both laboratory and online samples, we compared faces viewed at a simulated viewing distance at two different levels (medium and far) to faces that were viewed at a very near-simulated distance. Distance was simulated using a Gaussian blur function with higher levels of blur corresponding to greater simulated distance. We found that both medium and far simulated distances impaired memory performance overall relative to no simulated distance, with increased distance resulting in poorer memory. However, only far simulated distances impaired the CA relationship. In a fourth experiment, we found that a pre-test warning did not ameliorate this impairment of the CA relationship for faces viewed at a far simulated distance. These findings suggest that even high-confidence identifications made for faces viewed from long distances should be disregarded, and that estimator variables that impact memory may degrade the CA relationship when memory is reduced to critical levels."

The current study addressed this gap via secondary data analysis using logistic regression with a sample of 3,568 middle school students (mean age = 12.74; SD = 1.08). Results suggest that parental conversations about sex are a significant protective factor against suicidality, but only among adolescents who report having engaged in sexual activity."

Increasingly these exchanges rely on technology, with competing priorities that challenge cooperation and communication among key parties involved. The authors examine the factors that drive tensions between consumers and organizations in digital exchanges, as well as how and why interest groups, lawmakers, and bureaucrats (also known as the “iron triangle”) try to mediate these exchanges through policy and regulation. By explicating the nature of these relationships, the authors illustrate various trade‐offs faced by all parties and depict a novel, comprehensive framework to facilitate holistic assessment of the factors underlying these ubiquitous but complex digital relationships with vague ethical stewardship. This framework serves as a lens to help guide business and regulatory policymaking and as a platform for identifying future research opportunities."

Causes of friendship dissolution often mirror the reasons for friendship formation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that high self-monitors would report a change in shared activities as the reason for dissolving a relationship with a best friend, whereas low self-monitors would report a change in personal compatibility as the reason for dissolving a relationship with a best friend. In both studies, participants focused on a former best friend and indicated which of two causes (Study 1: loss of shared activities vs. loss of shared attitudes and values; Study 2: change in life circumstances vs. change in broad dispositions) was more influential in ending that friendship. They also completed the Self-Monitoring Scale; scores were used to create indices of self-monitoring in its univariate and bivariate (acquisitive vs. protective) forms. In both studies, protective self-monitoring was more consistently related to reasons for friendship dissolution, such that (a) high self-monitoring was associated with a loss of shared interests and (b) low self-monitoring was associated with a loss of personal compatibility as the bases for friendship dissolution. Effects were independent of potential third variables. Implications (e.g., nuanced assessment of self-monitoring), limitations (e.g., absence of longitudinal designs), and future directions (e.g., examining actor-partner effects) are discussed."

In May 2020, Feeding America reported an average increase of charitable food use by 59% compared to the previous year across 98% of their network food banks. At that time, an estimated 38% of visitors were new to charitable food assistance. Objective To explore food insecure, first-time visitors’ experiences seeking food assistance during COVID-19. Study Design, Setting, Participants A qualitative study design. Adults (ages 18-64) seeking food assistance at emergency food distribution sites in West Central Florida were recruited to participate in the study between November 2020 and July 2021. Individuals that were food insecure and first-time visitors due to COVID-19 participated in in-depth interviews (N = 18). Using food security as a multidimensional concept, the interview guide explored the impact of emergency food assistance on food availability, access, utilization, and stability. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed on ATLAS.ti 22. Applied thematic analysis was conducted to identify emergent themes. Results Participants were predominantly White (55.6%), female (72.2%), and between 40 and 59 years old (55.6%). There were seven salient themes including (1) crisis, added burdens, and barriers to pandemic assistance caused the need to seek food assistance, (2) fear of COVID-19 exposure and reducing risks, (3) new food purchasing behaviors to reduce spending, (4) pantry environments impact clients’ feelings, (5) pantry foods – hit or miss, (6) mixed quality of pantry foods, and (7) gaining firsthand insight on hunger as a societal problem and appreciation for services. These themes describe how emergency food assistance increased participants’ food availability and access during COVID-19, however, there were challenges in being able to use the pantry foods. Seeking food assistance made a difference in the way participants felt and impacted how they viewed hunger. Conclusions Study findings suggest that emergency food providers can support clients by helping navigate pandemic recovery as they experience food insecurity as a temporary situation.

In the setting of a geodesically complete M, we establish a sufficient condition for the equality of the maximal and minimal realizations of P ∇ in the (weighted) space Γ L μ p ( E ) of L μ p -type sections of E , where 1 < p < ∞ and d μ = e − ϕ d ν g , with ν g being the usual volume measure. Furthermore, we show that (the negative of) the maximal realization − H p , max generates an analytic quasi-contractive semigroup in Γ L μ p ( E ) , 1 < p < ∞ . Additionally, in the same context, we establish a coercivity estimate, which leads to the so-called separation property of the covariant Schrödinger operator (that is, P ∇ with X ≡ 0 and ϕ ≡ 0 ) in the (unweighted) space Γ L p ( E ) , 1 < p < ∞ .

For the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck differential expression acting on functions, that is, P d = Δ u + ( d ϕ ) ♯ u − X u + V u , where Δ is the (non-negative) scalar Laplacian on M and V is a locally integrable real-valued function, we consider another way of realizing P d as an operator in L μ p ( M ) and, by imposing certain geometric conditions on M, we prove another semigroup generation result.

One hallmark of aging is the loss of proteostasis which is caused in part by alterations to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and lysosome-autophagy system leading to impaired function and maintenance of mass in tissues such as skeletal muscle. In the instance of skeletal muscle, the impairment of function occurs early in the aging process and is dependent on proteostatic mechanisms. The UPS plays a pivotal role in degradation of misfolded and aggregated proteins. For the purpose of this review, we will discuss the role of the UPS system in the context of age-related loss of muscle mass and function. We highlight the significant role that E3 ubiquitin ligases play in the turnover of key components (e.g., mitochondria and neuromuscular junction) essential to skeletal muscle function and the influence of aging. In addition, we will briefly discuss the contribution of the UPS system to lifespan. By understanding the UPS system as part of the proteostasis network in age-related diseases and disorders such as sarcopenia, new discoveries can be made and new interventions can be developed which will preserve muscle function and maintain quality of life with advancing age."

Tumor location plays a role in patient prognosis, with tumors proximal to the lateral ventricles (LVs) presenting with worse overall survival, increased expression of stem cell genes, and increased incidence of distal tumor recurrence. This may be due in part to interaction of GBM with factors of the subventricular zone (SVZ), including those contained within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, direct interaction of GBM tumors with CSF has not been proved and would be hindered in the presence of an intact ependymal cell layer.MethodsHere, we investigate the ependymal cell barrier and its derived extracellular matrix (ECM) fractones in the vicinity of a GBM tumor. Patient-derived GBM cells were orthotopically implanted into immunosuppressed athymic mice in locations distal and proximal to the LV. A PBS vehicle injection in the proximal location was included as a control. At four weeks post-xenograft, brain tissue was examined for alterations in ependymal cell health via immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.ResultsWe identified local invading GBM cells within the LV wall and increased influx of CSF into the LV-proximal GBM tumor bulk compared to controls. In addition to the physical disruption of the ependymal cell barrier, we also identified increased signs of compromised ependymal cell health in LV-proximal tumor-bearing mice. These signs include increased accumulation of lipid droplets, decreased cilia length and number, and decreased expression of cell channel proteins. We additionally identified elevated numbers of small fractones in the SVZ within this group, suggesting increased indirect CSF-contained molecule signaling to tumor cells.ConclusionsOur data is the first to show that LV-proximal GBMs physically disrupt the ependymal cell barrier in animal models, resulting in disruptions in ependymal cell biology and increased CSF interaction with the tumor bulk. These findings point to ependymal cell health and CSF-contained molecules as potential axes for therapeutic targeting in the treatment of GBM."

There is an urgent need to better understand these risks and to spur more secure payment behavior. This research aims to develop knowledge graphs of the mobile payment platform based on deep learning for risk analysis and policy inferences. We identify entities from collected policy documents, extract the relationships among the entities, and draw a risk knowledge graph on mobile payments. The use of unsupervised semi-automatic knowledge acquisition, we argue, can reduce the risk of mobile payment caused by a lack of knowledge. A significant benefit of this method is that risk knowledge can be acquired without supervision. Unlike other models, the absence of manual labeling allows for the relation extraction of triples to be unsupervised, while the previous triplet extraction was supervised. Compared with other unsupervised models, the precision of our model is improved, and the recall is the same as that of previous unsupervised shutdown extraction.Unsupervised relationship extraction can extract text relationships quickly and on a large scale, saving human resources for labeling.This method offers a potential solution to a fundamental problem; the content and quantity of policy documents exceed organizations’ and individuals’ ability to understand them. Our approach suggests the viability of developing a national policy risk knowledge graph to help mobile payment platforms understand national policies and reduce platforms’ operational risks while allowing users to quickly learn the risks of mobile payments and minimize the impact of those risks."

Various proximate mechanisms for this memory effect have been proposed, including mortality salience, that humans are more likely to remember information related to death, and animate items (e.g., <i>shark</i>, <i>tiger</i>) are more likely to elicit thoughts of death than inanimate items (e.g., <i>volleyball</i>, <i>towel</i>). Mortality salience was manipulated in Experiment 1. Animate items were recalled more than inanimate items and threatening items were recalled more than nonthreatening items, but there was no significant effect of mortality salience. For Experiment 2, norming data were collected rating the word stimuli from the previous experiment on the characteristics of arousal, valence, likelihood to capture attention, and likelihood to elicit thoughts of death. These ratings along with threat ratings and animacy status of the items were included in a regression analysis with the frequency of recall of the items in Experiment 1. In addition to animacy, likelihood to capture attention and likelihood to elicit thoughts of death were significant predictors of recall, suggesting that these characteristics could be at least partly responsible for the animacy effect."

A stratified random cluster sampling method was used to select 10,070 students aged 11−18 years old from schools in Shanghai. Self-reported questionnaires were collected, weight-related statuses were divided into three categories and six specific health risk behaviors were classified into two groups: positive or negative. Overall, 27.82% of the adolescents were classified as being overweight and obese (35.61% of boys and 18.21% of girls), 43.45% perceived themselves as too heavy and 30.46% experienced weight teasing in the past. Among overweight or obese participants, 50.55% have been teased about their weight, and 77.48% perceived themselves as too heavy. Weight perception and weight teasing were significantly associated with health risk behaviors rather than the actual body weight status based on BMI, especially regarding binge eating behavior (body weight status (BMI): p > 0.05, underweight perception: OR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.03−1.34; weight teasing for more than once a year: OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.76−2.27). In addition, weight perception and weight teasing were significantly associated with health risk behaviors, mainly in normal and overweight/obese groups but not in underweight groups.

This study presents procedures for analyzing data derived from both methods to examine exercise-related walking and running, as well as determine evidence for alignment between these methods. The participants ( N = 29) wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ and completed four EMA surveys/day across 2 weeks to report exercise (mode and duration). GT3X+ counts per 10 s were processed using the Crouter two-regression model to identify periods of walking/running (coefficient of variation in activity counts ≤10% and >0%). Two reviewers visually inspected Crouter two-regression model data and recorded durations of walking/running in time blocks corresponding to EMA reports of exercise. The data were classified as “aligned” if the duration of walking/running between methods were within 20% of one another. Frequency analyses determined the proportion of aligned versus nonaligned exercise durations. Reviewer reliability was examined by calculating interobserver agreement (classification of aligned vs. nonaligned) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; duration based on coefficient of variation). Of the 139 self-reported bouts of walking and running exercise, 25% were classified as aligned with the Crouter two-regression model coefficient of variation. Initial interobserver agreement was 91, and ICCs across data classified as aligned (ICC = .992) and nonaligned (ICC = .960) were excellent. These novel procedures offer a means of isolating exercise-related physical activity for further analysis. Due to the inability to align evidence in most cases, we discuss key considerations for optimizing EMA survey questions, choice in accelerometer-based device, and future directions for visual analysis procedures.

The measure is widely used by researchers to explore the relationship between feeding style and child weight status but has not been evaluated comprehensively in a review or meta-analysis. The aims of this study were to 1) compare established median cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness in parent feeding (k = 5; see Hughes et al., 2012) to current median splits along these two dimensions for a larger sample of articles (k = 19) and 2) evaluate the relation between children's BMI, demandingness and responsiveness, and parent feeding style categories. Results indicated that the cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness initially established based on five studies of low-income families did not differ significantly with the addition of 19 studies. Child BMI z-scores (k = 8) were above average for all four parent feeding style categories and highest for indulgent parents, which was consistent with the literature outlining low-income children at higher risk for obesity and children of indulgent parents being particularly at risk. While heterogeneity of samples should be considered, study results suggested that the CFSQ distribution for responsiveness and demandingness was relatively generalizable across low-income samples, though heterogeneity was higher among caregiver's feeding style categories. Furthermore, the study confirmed that parent feeding styles were related to child weight status in a meaningful way, but all children in these low-income samples, on average, were heavier than their same-aged peers across all parent feeding styles."

While we use higher-order derivatives in the Taylor expansion, we do not use finite difference formulas or lengthy analytical expressions for evaluating them. On the other hand, we use exact derivative evaluations which are obtained by using recursive formulas derived from the governing differential equation itself. Thus, our method avoids round-off effects and the use of symbolic manipulation systems, and requires much less computational effort when compared to other existing methods for producing results of comparable accuracy. We also find that our numerical results are in excellent agreement with the several approximate solutions obtained previously.

The main goal was to develop a taxonomy of errors for such situations. Several tasks with differing characteristics and demands on the problem solver were used: the simulation of a chocolate producing company (CHOCO FINE), the simulation of a tribe of semi-nomads in the Sahel zone (MORO), and the simulation of wildfires engaging fire-fighting units (WINFIRE). Observing participants and teams working on these simulations, we refer to specific cases and describe 24 errors related to the steps of human problem solving and dynamic decision making. A theory is then presented which attempts to explain the causes of these errors occurring in microworld contexts. Whereas most existing theories focus on cognitive explanations, the theory presented explains human error as a result of the interaction of emotions, motivations, and cognition. The current study not only extends the taxonomy and list of human errors, but especially addresses the lack of theoretical explanations in the literature on human error. The findings provide a starting point for further theory development and empirical testing and could be applied in training programs; hopefully contributing to sensitivity and awareness of the demands of complex, dynamic, and uncertain problems, and ultimately contributing to fewer human errors."

Given this background, this paper identifies how green bonds transmit information with other assets from three aspects return, volatility, and tail risks. We apply the time-frequency generalized spillover index method and the MVMQ-CAViaR model to shed light on this issue. Our empirical evidence shows that green bonds and fixed-income assets have strong pairwise information transmission in both the return and volatility spillovers, while the equity assets produce the most extreme risk spillovers. The green-connected assets (Green investment stocks and energy commodities) always display weak spillover effects, revealing that few investors have a green preference in the Chinese green bonds market. Moreover, we find that the green bonds would have a different net spillover role across frequency scales and that there are some asymmetric characteristics in extreme risk contagion, which also supplements the understanding of the information transmission modes. In short, this paper provides a comprehensive view of the cross-market information dependencies of Chinese green bonds, thereby obtaining some instructive implications for both green bond investors and policymakers."

However, as it is difficult to detect a fake rating, fraudulent users can potentially unfairly impact the rating’s aggregated score. This fraudulent behavior can negatively affect customers and businesses. To improve rating systems, in this paper, we take a novel mechanism-design approach to increase the cost of fake ratings while providing incentives for honest ratings. However, designing such a mechanism is a challenging task, as it is not possible to detect fake ratings since raters might rate a same service differently. Our proposed mechanism RewardRating is inspired by the stock market model in which users can invest in their ratings for services and receive a reward on the basis of future ratings. We leverage the fact that, if a service’s rating is affected by a fake rating, then the aggregated rating is biased toward the direction of the fake rating. First, we formally model the problem and discuss budget-balanced and incentive-compatibility specifications. Then, we suggest a profit-sharing scheme to cover the rating system’s requirements. Lastly, we analyze the performance of our proposed mechanism."

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to report on a total quality management (TQM) implementation as a sample motivational case to support the need for a new work from anywhere (WFA) stakeholder framework that can be used by other companies as they build, maintain, and continuously improve a WFA culture and environment for successful Quality 4.0 and COVID-19 initiatives.   Design/methodology/approach Quality 4.0 that specifies an adaptive quality environment can help organizations quickly identify and respond to problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing a Lean Six Sigma implementation through the lens of Quality 4.0 in a case study, the authors propose a new stakeholder engagement framework for companies to build, maintain, and continuously improve the culture and environment for facilitating social interactions.   Findings The authors’ proposed framework consists of three major phases: (1) identify and plan stakeholder management, (2) manage stakeholder engagement, and (3) sustain stakeholder engagement. The first phase entails organizations supporting a culture of trust, engaging, and empowering stakeholders, identifying stakeholders, planning for stakeholder management, and inquiring about problems in the process. The second phase requires engaging stakeholders via participatory buy-in. The third phase focuses on monitoring stakeholder relationships, including modifying strategies and plans.   Practical implications This study bears some valuable implications for practitioners. First, the stakeholder management process should be established upon a culture that promotes trust, engagement, and empowerment. Second, the authors identify tools that can assist in the execution of WFA activities. Third, the organizational team needs to actively manage the WFA stakeholders and then sustain the stakeholder relationships. Finally, the implementation of the framework herein can be supported and strengthened by tools and techniques that promote participation and buy-in from stakeholders to ensure the project team hears, trusts, and values their contributions.   Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature and provides practical guidance for managers to effectively manage the workforce and engage stakeholders. "

Based on our deeper biosynthetic understanding, a biomimetic total synthesis of (+)-nocardioazine B is accomplished in merely seven steps and 23.2% overall yield. This pathway accesses regio- and stereoselectively C3-isoprenylated analogs of (+)-nocardioazine B, using the same number of steps and in similar efficiency. The successful strategy mandated that the biomimetic C3-prenylation step be executed early. The use of an unprotected carboxylic acid of Trp led to high diastereoselectivity toward formation of key intermediates <i>exo</i>-<b>12a</b>, <i>exo</i>-<b>12b</b>, and <i>exo</i>-<b>12c</b> (&gt;19:1). Evidence shows that <i>N</i>1-methylation causes the prenylation reaction to bifurcate away to result in a C2-normal-prenylated isomer. Nocardioazine A, possessing an isoprenoidal-epoxide bridge, inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated membrane efflux, in multidrug-resistant mammalian colon cancer cells. As several P-gp inhibitors have failed due to their toxicity effects, endogenous amino-acid-derived noncytotoxic inhibitors (from the nocardioazine core) are worthy leads toward a rejuvenated strategy against resistant carcinomas. This total synthesis provides direct access to Trp-derived isoprenylated DKP natural products and their derivatives."

Although we strongly believe that studying male sexual victimization is a highly important research and policy endeavour, we have concerns with the approach taken by DiMarco and colleagues to discuss these incidents. Specifically, we critique their paper by addressing the definitions of rape used by the authors, questioning their interpretation of national victim surveys, evaluating their analysis of the underreporting of male rape, and highlighting the heteronormative framework they use to outline the landscape of male sexual victimization. With this commentary, we call for a holistic, nuanced, and balanced study of male sexual victimization that recognizes the reality of both female-on-male and male-on-male violence, the experiences of survivors, and multi-layered barriers that male victims often encounter."

Over more than four years, we followed and measured the developments and progress in two separate, major change initiatives related to different business processes in one case organization. The framework has a specific focus on the need for a clear and accepted change purpose. It tries to explicate the nature of change purpose and proposes different interrelated attributes related to the clear content of a change purpose (relevant, justified, urgent, clear destination, clear scope and explicit goals) but also attributes of how the change purpose then should be communicated to be jointly accepted. This operationalization of the nature of change purpose could also inform the current general discussion on purpose related to leadership. MAD statement The intention of this article is to Make A Difference (MAD) by addressing problems with change readiness by focusing specifically on change purpose. We explicate the nature of change purpose and operationalize it, proposing a conceptual framework grounded in a longitudinal study of two major change initiatives. The framework could help organizations create an accepted purpose for organizational change initiatives related to business processes. We discuss attributes related to the clear content of a change purpose (relevant, justified, urgent, clear destination, clear scope and explicit goals) and how the change purpose should be communicated to be jointly accepted."

DESIGN: Longitudinal study.
SETTING: Patient-level data from electronic medical records were joined with Press Ganey (www.pressganey.com) satisfaction data for a single post-acute care inpatient rehabilitation facility in northeast Florida.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who participated in the inpatient rehabilitation survey (N=4,785).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included final patient satisfaction scores, overall rating of care during the stay, and willingness to recommend the hospital to others.
RESULTS: This study found the personal issues domain to be the most important factor in determining the final patient satisfaction score, overall rating of care, and likelihood to recommend the hospital to others, followed by the physical therapist, nurse, discharge, and food domains (P<.0001). Within the personal issues domain score, staff promptness and explanation upon arrival were areas identified as opportunities to make improvements that would result in the greatest positive effect.
CONCLUSIONS: This work represents novel findings by investigating the major determinants of positive patient experience in a rehabilitation hospital setting.

There is limited evidence about access to care issues (delayed and forgone care) due to the pandemic among people with disability (PWD).
METHODS: This study used the 2020 National Health Interview Survey data. Disability status was defined by disability severity (moderate and severe disability), type, and the number of disabling limitations. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression (adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics) were conducted to estimate delayed/forgone care (yes/no) between PWD and people without disability (PWoD).
RESULTS: Among 17,528 US adults, 40.7% reported living with disability. A higher proportion of respondents with severe and moderate disability reported delaying care than PWoD (severe=33.2%; moderate=27.5%; PWoD=20.0%, P <0.001). The same was true for forgone medical care (severe=26.6%; moderate=19.0%; PWoD=12.2%, P <0.001). Respondents with a moderate disability {delayed [odds ratio (OR)=1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.19, 1.49]; forgone [OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.28, 1.67]} and a severe disability [delayed (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.27, 1.83); forgone (OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.49, 2.27)] were more likely to report delayed medical care and forgone medical care compared with PWoD. These findings were consistent across the models using disability type and the number of limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: PWD were more likely to experience COVID-19-related delays in or forgone medical care compared with PWoD.

This research analyzes the electrical appliances and energy consumption data from institutional buildings and the factors that drive energy consumption. The analyses show that: (1) energy consumption patterns are dependent on building characteristics and use; (2) the number of appliances in a building influences the peak electricity consumption; (3) vending machines and fridges consume significant amounts of electricity; it has been proven (by minimum building energy loads) that buildings that have more vending machines have significantly higher minimum loads than no or fewer vending machines; and (4) the energy-saving potential from desktops and monitors rose to 60 kWh during lunchtime and 500 kWh at night."

Given the huge future growth of the carbon emissions of the transport sector and its tight links to socio-economic development, the introduction of new energy vehicles can not only reduce carbon emissions but also decarbonize the entire economic system by decreasing carbon intensity. Taking advantage of a promotion project in China as a natural experiment, this paper explores the causal effect of promoting new energy vehicles on reducing carbon intensity. Our empirical results show that the promotion of new energy vehicles decreases the carbon intensity in demonstration cities by about 4.5% and decomposition analyses show that less than one-fifths of the decrease comes from the reduction of carbon emissions, and the other four-fifths result from the increases in outputs. Mechanism analyses suggest that in terms of passenger vehicles, this project increases the number of newly registered pure electric passengers motor vehicles, but has no influence on public transportation and taxis. Moreover, the promotion of new energy vehicles by this project is not brought about by the subsidy policy for the private purchase of them. We also put forward some policy recommendations for constructing a low-carbon transport system."

Findings demonstrate how future teachers wrestled with college readiness, and the shift in perspective from a skills-based definition to an understanding of it as a partnership between student and teacher. Our findings suggest the need for teacher preparation curriculum 1) focused on college and career readiness as more than a set of standards, and 2) framed within culturally responsive pedagogies.

Our results suggest that firms with an LID who serves on the audit committee are associated with higher accruals quality. The results suggest that these firms are associated with an increase in accruals quality equal to 6.60% of the accruals quality metric's median value. We also find that as board size increases, the positive influence of an LID on accruals quality weakens—but only for firms with an LID who does not serve on the audit committee. Supplemental analyses indicate that our inferences still hold when using a changes model, when examining a firm's initial adoption or elimination of the LID position, and when using an entropy balancing approach.

Also, vaccine efficacy against VCD was higher against dengue prM/E amino acid sequences closer to the vaccine inserts. We integrated the nAb and sequence data types by assessing nAb titers as a correlate of sequence-specific VCD separately in the vaccine arm and in the placebo arm. In both vaccine and placebo recipients the correlation of nAb titer with sequence-specific VCD was stronger for dengue nAb contact site sequences closer to the vaccine (p = 0.005 and p = 0.012, respectively). The risk of VCD in vaccine (placebo) recipients was 6.7- (1.80)-fold lower at the 90th vs 10th percentile of nAb for viruses perfectly matched to CYD-TDV, compared to 2.1- (0.78)-fold lower at the 90th vs 10th percentile for viruses with five amino acid mismatches. The evidence for a stronger sequence-distance dependent correlate of risk for the vaccine arm indicates departure from the Prentice criteria for a valid sequence-distance specific surrogate endpoint and suggests that the nAb marker may affect dengue risk differently depending on whether nAbs arise from infection or also by vaccination. However, when restricting to baseline-seropositive 9-14 year-olds, the correlation pattern became more similar between the vaccine and placebo arms, supporting nAb titers as an approximate surrogate endpoint in this population. No sequence-specific nAb titer correlates of VCD were seen in baseline-seronegative participants. Integrated immune response/pathogen sequence data correlates analyses could help increase knowledge of correlates of risk and surrogate endpoints for other vaccines against genetically diverse pathogens.

The assignment encouraged students to develop both macro- and micro-level creative social theory analysis using a fictional society that often touches on the themes of futurism, science fiction, or postapocalyptic settings. These scenarios allowed students to engage in world-building linked to systems of oppression that were analyzed through various perspectives, including Marxist theories, critical race theory, and feminist theories.

These shifts have occurred alongside internet tobacco purchasing restrictions being proposed and enacted across the US. The aim of this study was to identify motivations for and against purchasing tobacco and e-cigarettes online, to better understand potential impacts or loopholes.
METHODS: We surveyed 463 US adults who reported ever purchasing tobacco or e-cigarettes in April 2021, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants who reported purchasing tobacco or e-cigarettes online were asked to describe their reasons for doing so. Those who reported never purchasing online were asked to describe their reasons. Responses were triple-coded and thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: Most respondents (n=330; 71.3%) had purchased tobacco or e-cigarettes online. We identified 14 reasons for purchasing tobacco or e-cigarettes online across four themes: price (cheaper online, discounts, bulk purchases, avoiding taxes), product characteristics (availability, quality), buying experience (convenience, time, COVID-19 concerns, avoiding shame, discretion, avoiding salespersons, reading reviews), and curiosity. We identified 13 reasons for not purchasing tobacco or e-cigarette products online across seven themes: buying experience (convenience, time, discretion, seeing the product), concerns (legality, safety, quality), consumption, price, supporting local, unaware, and uninterested.
CONCLUSIONS: Both online and offline purchasers stated price and convenience motivated their choice to purchase tobacco or e-cigarettes online. Though few participants mentioned purchasing illicit products, concerns about legality and quality of online purchases were raised, and there was some awareness that online purchases attracted lower taxation."

With proof testing, components are subjected to stresses comparable to those observed during service load histories resulting in the remaining ones having assured minimum reliabilities. The degree to which the reliability of the remaining parts is assured depends on the proof test protocol, which includes multiple variables such as stress level, realistic sampling of flaws, complex geometries, multiaxial stresses, transient loading histories, time‐dependent damage due to slow crack growth and/or fatigue, and change in material behavior due to temperature and/or environmental conditions. This paper advances the early work done on proof test theory, which was limited to simple stress states, to include general stress and material states. The theory introduced in this paper takes into account practical conditions often encountered in industrial applications. This advanced proof test theory was coded into the CARES/Life code (Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures/Life). Examples are provided to demonstrate the theory."

Emerging blockchain technology can help improve credit-reporting ability through greater integrity, decentralization, transparency, security, and reliability. Aiming to address the problem of extensive credit investigation data and privacy protection, we propose a blockchain-based model to realize access control and management of the shared transaction information in the supply chain. Our model adopts a consensus mechanism to solve the problem of large credit investigation data and privacy protection of credit investigation data and realizes access control and management of the shared data chain. In our model, data are stored on the cloud server and shared with the proxy reencryption method. The model's data structure and workflow are designed to facilitate specific applications in supply chain finance. The embedded blockchain technology helps build the open shared reference architecture and establish the entire life cycle of a monitoring mechanism. The existing blockchain consensus mechanism has low security and a large resource consumption; as such, it is particularly important to design a new consensus mechanism to serve the credit investigation system. In this study, blockchain data sharing and traceability can be realized by improving the consensus mechanism, helping to improve the existing credit investigation service system. Our findings help optimize the existing supply chain financial credit system and enhance the efficiency of supply chain financing."

Objectives: To describe alignment of registered dietitian nutritionists' (RDNs) documented nutrition care with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' EBNPG for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and examine impact of a midpoint training on care alignment with the guideline.
Methods: In this 2-year, quasi-experimental study, 19 RDNs providing outpatient medical nutrition therapy to adults with diabetes (<i>n</i> = 562) documented 787 initial and follow-up encounters. At study midpoint, RDNs received a guideline content training. A validated, automated tool was used to match standardized nutrition care process terminology (NCPT) in the documentation to NCPT expected to represent guideline implementation. A congruence score ranging from 0 (recommendation not identified) to 4 (recommendation fully implemented) was generated based on matching. Multilevel linear regression was used to examine pre-to-post training changes in congruence scores.
Results: Most patients (~75%) had only one documented RDN encounter. At least one guideline recommendation was fully implemented in 67% of encounters. The recommendations ""individualize macronutrient composition"" and ""education on glucose monitoring"" (partially or fully implemented in 85 and 79% of encounters, respectively) were most frequently implemented. The mean encounter congruence scores were not different from pre-to-post guideline training (<i>n</i> = 19 RDNs, 519 encounters pre-training; <i>n</i> = 14 RDNs, 204 encounters post-training; β = -0.06, SE = 0.04; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.03).
Conclusions: Most RDN encounters had documented evidence that at least one recommendation from the EBNPG was implemented. The most frequently implemented recommendations were related to improving glycemic control. A midpoint guideline training had no impact on alignment of care with the guideline."

METHODS: For this retrospective study, we examined the electronic health records of privately insured patients in the Healthjump database, provided by the COVID-19 Research Database Consortium. We examined 17.98 million unique visit records of 2.93 million patients from March through December 2019 and 22.17 million records of 3.55 million patients from March through December 2020. We conducted a descriptive analysis and used multiple logistic regression to examine differences in the use of telehealth services among 3 racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic people.
RESULTS: Telehealth visits before and during COVID-19 accounted for 8.3% and 10.9% of total visits, respectively, with a peak of 15.5% in April 2020.

RESULTS: Telehealth visits before and during COVID-19 accounted for 8.3% and 10.9% of total visits, respectively, with a peak of 15.5% in April 2020. Pre-COVID-19, Hispanic patients had a significantly lower monthly utilization rate (5.3%) than non-Hispanic White patients (8.4%, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and non-Hispanic Black patients (10.4%, <i>P</i> = .001). During the pandemic study period, Hispanic patients were 41% less likely than non-Hispanic White patients to have a telehealth visit, controlling for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of using telehealth was lower among Hispanic patients than among non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black patients during the pandemic. Culturally sensitive measures are needed to support telehealth use among the Hispanic population."

In the light of social identity theory, this study considered susceptibility to interpersonal influence (SIPI) and self-expressive brands (SEBs) on consumer social networking engagement behaviors. Data from our research demonstrated that SEBs and SIPI were positively related to brand attachment, which also impacted liking, sharing, and commenting on social networking sites (SNS). In addition, brand attachment played a positive mediating role among SEB, SIPI, and consumer engagement on SNS. The research explores the factors affecting consumer engagement on SNS with a new insight and guides brand managers to seek efficient ways to drive consumers to engage on online social networks.</p>"

Self-management of chronic diseases is essential to improve health behaviours and health outcomes. Technology-assisted interventions have shown to improve self-management of chronic diseases. Virtual avatars can be a key factor for the acceptance of these technologies. Addison Care is a home-based telecare solution equipped with a virtual avatar named Addison, connecting older persons with their caregivers via an easy-to-use technology. A central advantage is that Addison Care provides access to self-management support for an up-to-now highly under-represented population-older persons with chronic disease(s), which enables them to profit from e-health in everyday life.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pragmatic, non-randomised, one-arm pilot study applying an embedded mixed-methods approach will be conducted to examine user experience, usability and user engagement of the virtual avatar Addison. Participants will be at least 65 years and will be recruited between September 2022 and November 2022 from hospitals during the discharge process to home care. Standardised instruments, such as the User Experience Questionnaire, System Usability Scale, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, Short-Form-8-Questionnaire, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Stendal Adherence with Medication Score and Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Diseases Scale, as well as survey-based assessments, semistructured interviews and think-aloud protocols, will be used. The study seeks to enrol 20 patients that meet the criteria.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the ethic committee of the German Society for Nursing Science (21-037). The results are intended to be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through conference papers.

DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was carried out between October 2021 and March 2022 using data from 2016 to 2021.
METHODS: Propensity score analysis was used to match hospital and community-level characteristics, implementing nearest neighbour matching to adjust for pre-treatment differences between magnet and non-magnet hospitals to account for multi-level differences. Secondary data were obtained from all operational acute-care facilities in the United States that participated in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' hospital value-based purchasing (HVBP) program. Dependent variables were the four value-based purchasing domains that comprise the Total Performance Score (TPS; Clinical Care, Person and Community Engagement, Safety, and Efficiency and Cost Reduction).
RESULTS: Magnet hospitals had increased odds for better scores in the HVBP domains of Clinical Care and Person and Community Engagement, and decreased odds for having better Safety. However, no statistically significant difference was found for the Efficiency domain or the TPS.
CONCLUSION: Measuring performance equitably across organizations of various sizes serving diverse communities remains a key factor in ensuring distributive justice. Analysing the TPS components can identify complex influences of community-level characteristics not evident at the composite level. More research is needed where community and nurse-level factors may indirectly affect patient safety.
IMPACT: This study's findings on the role of community contexts can inform policymakers designing value-based care programs and healthcare management administrators deliberating on magnet certification investments across diverse community settings.

pub.1151307114,ur.0712606614.74,UNF,"Byrge, Lisa",Psychology,Atypical gaze patterns in autistic adults are heterogeneous across but reliable within individuals,"BackgroundAcross behavioral studies, autistic individuals show greater variability than typically developing individuals. However, it remains unknown to what extent this variability arises from heterogeneity across individuals, or from unreliability within individuals. Here, we focus on eye tracking, which provides rich dependent measures that have been used extensively in studies of autism. Autistic individuals have an atypical gaze onto both static visual images and dynamic videos that could be leveraged for diagnostic purposes if the above open question could be addressed.MethodsWe tested three competing hypotheses: (1) that gaze patterns of autistic individuals are less reliable or noisier than those of controls, (2) that atypical gaze patterns are individually reliable but heterogeneous across autistic individuals, or (3) that atypical gaze patterns are individually reliable and also homogeneous among autistic individuals. We collected desktop-based eye tracking data from two different full-length television sitcom episodes, at two independent sites (Caltech and Indiana University), in a total of over 150 adult participants (N = 48 autistic individuals with IQ in the normal range, 105 controls) and quantified gaze onto features of the videos using automated computer vision-based feature extraction.ResultsWe found support for the second of these hypotheses. Autistic people and controls showed equivalently reliable gaze onto specific features of videos, such as faces, so much so that individuals could be identified significantly above chance using a fingerprinting approach from video epochs as short as 2 min. However, classification of participants into diagnostic groups based on their eye tracking data failed to produce clear group classifications, due to heterogeneity in the autistic group.LimitationsThree limitations are the relatively small sample size, assessment across only two videos (from the same television series), and the absence of other dependent measures (e.g., neuroimaging or genetics) that might have revealed individual-level variability that was not evident with eye tracking. Future studies should expand to larger samples across longer longitudinal epochs, an aim that is now becoming feasible with Internet- and phone-based eye tracking.ConclusionsThese findings pave the way for the investigation of autism subtypes, and for elucidating the specific visual features that best discriminate gaze patterns—directions that will also combine with and inform neuroimaging and genetic studies of this complex disorder."

In a previously published 9-month clinical trial of choline supplementation in children with FASD, we reported that postnatal choline was associated with improved performance on a hippocampal-dependent recognition memory task. The current paper describes the neurophysiological correlates of that memory performance for trial completers.
Methods: Children with FASD (<i>N</i> = 24) who were enrolled in a clinical trial of choline supplementation were followed for 9 months. Delayed recall on a 9-step elicited imitation task (EI) served as the behavioral measure of recognition memory. Neurophysiological correlates of memory were assessed <i>via</i> event-related potentials (ERP).
Results: Delayed recall on EI was correlated with two ERP components commonly associated with recognition memory in young children: middle latency negative component (Nc amplitude; range: <i>r</i> = -0.41 to <i>r</i> = -0.44) and positive slow wave (PSW area under the curve; range: <i>r</i> = -0.45 to <i>r</i> = -0.63). No significant ERP differences were observed between the choline and placebo groups at the conclusion of the trial.
Conclusion: Although the small sample size limits the ability to draw clear conclusions about the treatment effect of choline on ERP, the results suggest a relationship between memory performance and underlying neurophysiological status in FASD. This trial was registered."

However, in extremely reducing environments, other oxidation states of phosphorus such as +3 may also be stable. Such environments—if prevalent globally—may determine planetary habitability, which is in part governed by nutrient availability, including the availability of the element phosphorus. Here we show a route to P liberation from water-rock reactions that are thought to be common throughout the Solar System. We report the speciation of phosphorus in several serpentinite rocks and muds to include the ion phosphite (HPO3 2− with P3+) and show that reduction of phosphate to phosphite may be predicted from thermodynamic models of serpentinization. Furthermore, the amount of phosphite exceeds the amounts predicted from thermodynamic models in three of nine samples analyzed. As a result, as olivine and other silicates in ultramafic rocks alter to serpentine minerals, phosphorus as the significantly more soluble and reactive phosphite ion should be released under low redox conditions, liberating this key nutrient for life. Thus, this element may be accessible to developing life where water is in direct contact with ultramafic rock, providing a source of this nutrient to potentially habitable worlds."

No pharmacological treatment exists, but clinical management techniques, such as tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), prove effective in helping patients. Although effective, TRT is not widely offered, due to scarcity of expertise and complexity because of a high level of personalization. Within this study, a data-driven clinical decision support tool is proposed to guide clinicians in the delivery of TRT.
Methods: This research proposes the formulation of data analytics models, based on supervised machine learning (ML) techniques, such as classification models and decision rules for diagnosis, and action rules for treatment to support the delivery of TRT. A knowledge-based framework for clinical decision support system (CDSS) is proposed as a UI-based Java application with embedded WEKA predictive models and Java Expert System Shell (JESS) rule engine with a pattern-matching algorithm for inference (Rete). The knowledge base is evaluated by the accuracy, coverage, and explainability of diagnostics predictions and treatment recommendations.
Results: The ML methods were applied to a clinical dataset of tinnitus patients from the Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Center at Emory University School of Medicine, which describes 555 patients and 3,000 visits. The validated ML classification models for diagnosis and rules: association and actionable treatment patterns were embedded into the knowledge base of CDSS. The CDSS prototype was tested for accuracy and explainability of the decision support, with preliminary testing resulting in an average of 80% accuracy, satisfactory coverage, and explainability.
Conclusions: The outcome is a validated prototype CDS system that is expected to facilitate the TRT practice."

Several studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) and Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC), explored the genetic alterations among different ethnic groups. However, minority groups are often under-represented in these relevant studies and the genomic alterations among racial groups are not fully understood.
Methods: We analyze genomic characteristics among racial groups to understand the diversities and their impact on clinical outcomes.
Results: Native Americans had significantly higher rates of insertions and deletions than other races (P<0.001). Among patients with lung adenocarcinomas, EGFR and KRAS were the highest discrepancy genes in the different racial groups (P<0.001). The EGFR exon 21 L858R point mutation was three times higher in Asians than in all other races (P<0.001). Asians, Whites, and Blacks had 4.7%, 3.1%, and 1.8% ALK rearrangement, respectively (P<0.001). White patients had the highest rates of reported KRAS G12C (15.51%) than other races (P<0.001). Whites (17.2%), Blacks (15.1%), and Other (15.7%) had higher rates of STK11 mutation than Asians (3.94%) (P<0.001).

Apart from point mutations, structural variations, and fusion genes, we identified a significant amount of copy number alterations in each race.
Conclusions: The tumor genomic landscape is significantly distinct in different races. This data would shed light on the understanding of molecular alterations and their impacts on clinical management in different lung cancer patients."

While research has specified major forms and causal theories of police misconduct, especially regarding corruption and excessive force, scientific attention to police sexual misconduct (PSM) has been more limited and is addressed here. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue.   Design/methodology/approach  The current study was commissioned to examine PSM incidents ( n  = 50) between 2000 and 2009 in a large, metropolitan, police department in the USA. Data were extracted from agency internal affairs case files, personnel records and disciplinary histories for involved officers.    Findings Analyses identified common factors and trends across officers, complainants and sexual misconduct events that were dichotomized per case substantiation and observed on a severity continuum from unobtrusive to criminal conduct.   Originality/value Though findings did not evidence a deviant subculture often implicated in the police literature, specific opportunities to reduce officer misconduct, including intensifying administrative sanctioning and other perceptual deterrence measures, were identified.

Symptomatic treatment is available for PD but requires patients to make periodic clinic visits (2–3 times per year) for symptom assessment. Advanced telehealth technologies can enhance clinical care for PD but warrant an Internet-of-Things-based (IoT) infrastructure that can enable symptom monitoring in out-of-clinic settings, such as homes. In this paper, we present an edge and Fog device-based IoT framework and a machine learning-based telehealth infrastructure that can detect and classify hand movement tasks based on a clinical test (UPDRS) for remote symptom assessment. We used a pair of smart gloves integrated with finger flex sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a wireless embedded system (i.e., an edge device) to record the hand movements. The edge device (ESP32) detected the activity on the edge node and transmitted the data to the Fog node for classification. The Fog node (Raspberry pi) hosted the Machine Learning (ML) based activity classification models to classify UPDRS-based hand movement tasks. In this paper, we present the development of edge-fog-supported ML infrastructure. To develop ML models, we utilized the data of 9 participants (five healthy and four people with PD) who performed hand movements tasks while wearing the smart gloves. We developed and tested different classification models such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT) to identify which one fits best for such an edge-fog infrastructure for remote symptom assessment. Results showed that the SVM model outperformed others by giving 94% training, 94% testing, and 93% validation accuracy with a mean inference time of 560 μs on the Fog node. Our preliminary results are promising to further our research in deploying the edge-fog-driven ML-based telehealth infrastructure in real-world settings."

However, the previous reverse-engineering process was an inefficient timely manner approach, which was simple to measure the dimensions by the equipment, recorded and modeled by personnel who has engineering knowledge. For this reason, this research study focuses on developing reverse-engineering methods to support the previous reverse-engineering process, which is the parametric swept geometry definition and generation with a predefined feature template (FT) from point cloud data (PCD). PCD were recently obtained and used from the scanned images for facility management purposes. However, the geometry modeling for management in PCD required a lot of effort and time consumption. This research study focuses on the pipelines in mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems as a case study. The swept geometry, which includes ducts, cable trays, pipes, and H-beams, was modeled considering standardized dimensions and constraints in MEP systems in building construction. This study also finds how to generate the parametric swept geometry from PCD based on the predefined FT and provide engineers/designers with flexible reverse-engineering capabilities."

To date, PDAC lacks routine screening with no markers available for early detection. Exosomes are 40-150 nm-sized extracellular vesicles that contain DNA, RNA, and proteins. These exosomes are released by all cell types into circulation and thus can be harvested from patient body fluids, thereby facilitating a non-invasive method for PDAC detection. A bioinformatics analysis was conducted utilizing publicly available miRNA pancreatic cancer expression and genome databases. Through this analysis, we identified 18 miRNA with strong potential for PDAC detection. From this analysis, 10 (MIR31, MIR93, MIR133A1, MIR210, MIR330, MIR339, MIR425, MIR429, MIR1208, and MIR3620) were chosen due to high copy number variation as well as their potential to differentiate patients with chronic pancreatitis, neoplasms, and PDAC. These 10 were examined for their mature miRNA expression patterns, giving rise to 18 mature miRs for further analysis. Exosomal RNA from cell culture media was analyzed via RTqPCR and seven mature miRs exhibited statistical significance (miR-31-5p, miR-31-3p, miR-210-3p, miR-339-5p, miR-425-5p, miR-425-3p, and miR-429). These identified biomarkers can potentially be used for early detection of PDAC."

Some species of coral can physiologically acclimate to elevated temperatures, but the degree to which genetic variation underlies differences in this ability is currently unknown. Acclimation to elevated temperatures in coral has been hypothesized to be due to either alterations in the symbiont community or to changes in gene expression. The present study investigated the ability of Acropora cervicornis to acclimate to elevated temperatures, estimated the heritability of plasticity in upper thermal tolerance, and tested whether observed acclimation patterns could be explained by symbiont shuffling. Coral fragments from a nursery in the Florida Keys (USA) were acclimated at either ambient (27 ± 1°C) or elevated (30 ± 1°C) temperatures and then exposed to a second heat stress (32 ± 1°C) and monitored for mortality. Fragments acclimated to elevated temperatures showed significantly longer lifespans in the subsequent heat stress than did those acclimated at ambient temperature. The ability to acclimate to elevated temperatures differed significantly among coral genets, yielding low, but significant, estimates of broad-sense heritability. A subsequent experiment revealed no changes in either bacterial or dinoflagellate communities of symbionts as a result of acclimation, suggesting that symbiont shuffling did not account for the differences in lifespan between treatments. While estimates of heritability were low, the results suggest that plasticity in upper thermal tolerance significantly differs among coral genets, and that acclimation is likely a result of alterations in gene expression as opposed to symbiont shuffling.

Whether the recycled pipes guarantee performance and can be substituted for virgin pipes is also an issue in the process of being clarified. Furthermore, the variety of area characteristics and the specific serving conditions of the pipes significantly affect pipe service life. Therefore, the University of Sherbrooke and the Quebec Ministry of Transportation (MTQ) recently collaborated to conduct a project on the long-term performance of recycled and virgin HDPE pipes supplied by local manufacturers. This project included investigating stress-crack resistance (SCR) and predicting the service life of new corrugated HDPE pipes fabricated by Canadian manufacturers as well as corrugated HDPE pipes in field service in Quebec under natural aging. Notched specimens were cut directly from the HDPE pipe liner to evaluate their SCR. In addition, four exposure conditions were used: freeze–thaw cycles and exposure to saline, acidic, and alkaline solutions to predict the remaining lifetime of pipes. The SCR was investigated with the Florida test method in water at 3.10 MPa (450 psi) and 80°C, 4.48 MPa (650 psi) and 80°C, and 4.48 MPa and 70°C in compliance with FM 5-573. The data points at elevated temperatures were then shifted to predict the service life of pipes at lower service conditions with the Popelar’s shift method (PSM) and the rate process method (RPM), both of which are extrapolation methods. The results show that, before immersion in different solutions, the recycled could guarantee 100 years of service life as virgin pipes under service conditions of 10°C and 3.45 MPa (500 psi). After immersion, the decrease in SCR was related to the two steps of elevated temperature in the conditioned test and the Florida test, along with the harsh environment of the conditioned test. Moreover, RPM proved better than PSM, because the latter yielded nearly scattered, nonlinear data points."

For the internationalization of counseling to take place, leading to establishment and advancement, the counseling profession needs to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration. Such a process enables a meaningful inclusion of counselors in professional spaces to allow them to meet the socio-emotional needs of clients and communities. In this article, the authors examine the challenges and barriers counselors experience when participating in interdisciplinary professional environments, specifically in places where the counseling profession is a nascent field. We also recommend strategies for counselor educators, supervisors, trainees, practitioners, and professional organization leaders to employ in efforts to address and overcome some of the challenges and barriers and advocate for the inclusion of counselors as valued members in interdisciplinary settings."

Studies agree that quick incident clearance would translate into substantial savings for the motoring public. However, many factors influence how quickly an incident can be cleared. This paper investigated the influence of the incident location on incident clearance duration using a hierarchical Bayesian survival model. The study presented a statistical approach to examine disparities in incident clearance duration on different freeway segments (i.e., basic, merge, diverge, weaving, on-ramp, and off-ramp sections). In the analysis, data from 58,167 incidents that occurred on freeways in Jacksonville, Florida, for the years 2014–2017 were analyzed. The Bayesian hypothesis testing revealed credible differences in incident clearance durations among most freeway segment pairs. The model results indicated that basic freeway segments had the longest incident clearance durations, followed by diverge segments and off-ramps. Incidents that were crashes, were severe, resulted in shoulder blockage, occurred on weekends, and occurred on segments with high traffic volumes took significantly longer time to be cleared. The study findings could help practitioners strategically position and allocate appropriate incident response resources along the freeway corridors. Practitioners could consider depots along longer basic freeway segments and diverge segments to enable the quick arrival of incident response teams."

This paper analyzes the semantics and content of risk disclosure based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. From both long-term and short-term perspectives, this paper explores how the information effect and risk effect of risk disclosure play their respective roles. The results show that risk disclosure has a stronger risk effect at the semantic novelty level and a more substantial information effect at the risk content level. A novel aspect of the paper lies in the use of text analysis (semantic novelty and content richness) to characterize the structure of the risk factor disclosure. The study shows that initial IPO returns negatively correlate with semantic novelty and content richness. We show the interaction between risk effect and information effect on risk disclosure under the nature of the same stock plate.

BACKGROUND: Early mobilisation is recommended for the prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients, but the evidence remains inconclusive.
METHOD: Systematic literature search in Pubmed, CINAHL, PEDRo, Cochrane from inception to March 2022, and hand search in previous meta-analysis. Included were randomized trials or quality-improvement projects. meta-analysis was performed for Odds Ratios or mean differences including 95% Confidence Intervals for presence/duration of delirium. Risk of bias was assessed by using Joanna Briggs Quality criteria. meta-regression was performed to analyse heterogeneity.
RESULTS: The search led to 13 studies of low-moderate risk of bias including 2,164 patients. Early mobilisation reduced the risk of delirium by 47 % (13 studies, 2,164 patients, low to moderate risk of bias: Odds Ratio 0.53 (95 % Confidence Interval 0.34 till 0.83, p = 0.01), with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 78 %, p &lt; 0.001). Early mobilisation also reduced the duration of delirium by 1.8 days (3 studies, 296 patients, low-moderate risk of bias: Mean difference -1.78 days (95 % Confidence Interval -2.73 till -0.83 days, p &lt; 0.001), heterogeneity 0 % (p = 0.41). Other analyses such as low risk of bias studies, randomised trials, studies published ≥ 2017, high intensity, and mobilisation as stand-alone intervention showed no significant results, with conflicting certainty of evidence and high heterogeneity. meta-regression could not explain heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: There is an uncertain effect of mobilisation on delirium. Provision of early mobilisation to critical ill patients might prevent delirium. There is a possible effect of early mobilisation to shorten the duration of delirium. Due to the heterogeneity in the findings, further research to define the best method and dosage of early rehabilitation is required."

Crises of pleasure are periodic eruptions of discontent when consumption is disrupted by external forces. In this case, the pandemic also disrupted expressions of identity on social media, where identity is made legible through conspicuous consumption on social media in the early 2020s. Drawing from six qualitative focus group interviews conducted in the summer of 2020, we analyze how social media users interpret the accounts they follow posting content that seemingly violates social distancing guidelines during COVID-19. We find that consumption during the pandemic was highly contested and surveilled, with participants describing the disciplining power of social media and their use of news and public health guidelines to inform their identities. Both trends illustrate how surveilled modes of consumption characterize the post-lockdown consumption reality, which is polarized and partisan leading towards hedonist and puritanical models."

The Preventing Alzheimer's with Cognitive Training study (PACT) investigates a commercially available computerized cognitive training program targeting improved Useful Field of View Training (UFOVT) performance. The primary goal is to test the effectiveness of UFOVT to reduce incidence of clinically defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia with a secondary objective to examine if effects are moderated by plasma β-amyloid level or apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) allele status.
METHODS/DESIGN: This multisite study utilizes a randomized, controlled experimental design with blinded assessors and investigators. Individuals who are 65 years of age and older are recruited from the community. Eligible participants who demonstrate intact cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score > 25) are randomized and asked to complete 45 sessions of either a commercially available computerized-cognitive training program (UFOVT) or computerized games across 2.5 years. After three years, participants are screened for cognitive decline. For those demonstrating decline or who are part of a random subsample, a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is completed. Those who perform below a pre-specified level are asked to complete a clinical evaluation, including an MRI, to ascertain clinical diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia. Participants are asked to provide blood samples for analyses of Alzheimer's disease related biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: The PACT study addresses the rapidly increasing prevalence of dementia. Computerized cognitive training may provide a non-pharmaceutical option for reducing incidence of MCI or dementia to improve public health.
REGISTRATION: The PACT study is registered at http://Clinicaltrials.govNCT03848312."

However, a common method for evaluating the performance of DTs is lacking. Digital twins performance assessment mechanism is crucial when improving or monitoring any process or system in a business, such a strategy could serve as a guide to help researchers and practitioners create more effective digital twins. Guided by these challenges, we propose a structured method for measuring the performance and flexibility of digital twins, and our study provides a procedure for quantitative calculation of the performance of DTs based on four key performance indicators (KPIs). Moreover, we propose a new KPI, DTflex, for determining the flexibility of digital twins. We evaluated the performance of DTflex as a KPI to demonstrate its use as a simple tool for designers and practitioners to quickly compare different DT methodologies, which might provide valuable input for the iterative improvement of DTs to increase their efficiency in future applications. The knowledge provided along with the method proposed in this paper is expected to help researchers and practitioners working in different fields to compare DT methodologies and DT performance which will lead to higher efficiency DT solutions and increased re-usage of existing DTs."

The microwave‐assisted and Pd‐catalyzed reactions in ROH/HBF 4 , ROH/BF 3 ⋅ Et 2 O and in [BMIM][X]/[BMIM(SO 3 H)][OTf]/[BMIM][F] proved effective and gave respectable isolated yields within minutes. The scope of the Hiyama coupling reaction with triazenes was investigated in these media. The IL reagents and solvents were successfully employed to develop stepwise and sequential/tandem Hiyama‐Suzuki (H−S) and Hiyama‐Heck (H−H) methods.

Viele Fördergeldgeber verlangen FDM, da Forschung oft durch Steuergelder finanziert wird und daraus resultierende Daten nachhaltig für kommende Generationen hinterlegt werden sollten. In heutigen Laboren sind Papier‐Laborbücher allerdings noch immer gängige Praxis, und die Forschungsdaten werden oft in proprietären Dateiformaten ohne experimentellen Kontext gespeichert. Daten müssen über eine Rolle als bloßes Anhängsel von Publikationen hinauswachsen. Elektronische Laborbücher (ELN) und Laborinformationsmanagementsysteme (LIMS) ermöglichen es, Daten besser zu verwalten sowie Forschung und Veröffentlichung zu vereinfachen. Die in gutes FDM investierte Zeit zahlt sich später in vielerlei Hinsicht aus. Daher werden Mindestinformationsstandards (MI) für die Handhabung von Daten benötigt. Die Digitalisierung hält gerade Einzug in die Lehrpläne, sodass zukünftige Generationen von ChemikerInnen mit FDM und ELN‐Nutzung vertraut sein werden."

Data must mature beyond a mere supplement to a research paper. Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) allow researchers to manage data better and they simplify research and publication.

A machine learning approach,"With e-commerce emerging as a prominent mode of purchasing, there is a pressing need for businesses across the globe to understand online consumer purchase behavior and, in particular, their purchase intention. Information on purchase behavior provides valuable insights for designing marketing activities to reach wider target audiences, promote greater customer involvement, and achieve higher investment returns. This research builds a novel algorithm for predicting the purchase intention of e-commerce website users. The dataset for the study was publically available online. Under-sampling was used to remove the imbalance in the dataset, and two-stage feature selection was applied to identify the most important consumer characteristics. Then, the greedy search and the wrapper methods were used to generate a dataset comprising the five most relevant features. Subsequently, an improved machine learning model was proposed based on stacking well-known classifiers and compared against state-of-the-art Machine Learning classifiers using various measures to evaluate its performance. Our results showed that the proposed algorithm returned the best overall accuracies for 50–50, 66–34, and 80–20 splits of the dataset. It also outperformed other classifiers in extant literature.

Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth."

The selection of the optimal culvert renewal method can be an overwhelming process for transportation agencies, thereby warranting a user-friendly guidance tool. This study describes the culvert renewal selection tool (CREST) that prescribes an optimal technique based on various host culvert characteristics and multiple selection criteria. The CREST tool comprises 12 renewal techniques that include open cut, pipe bursting, and a variety of grouting and pipe lining techniques. Performance synthesis of these techniques based on five criteria form the core of the CREST tool, which subsequently leverages the principles of the analytical hierarchy process for decision-making. The CREST model is demonstrated for application for reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) and corrugated metal pipe (CMP) culverts considering nonstructural, semistructural, and full-structural renewal categories. Monte Carlo simulation procedures are adopted for determining the user-defined criteria preferences for demonstration purposes. The CREST tool and the results of this study will provide primitive guidance to transportation agencies for choosing culvert renewal techniques."

We examined the association of ePWV with incident HF and its subtypes in a large community sample of 6814 middle-aged and older adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
Methods: Participants with an ejection fraction ≤40 % were classified as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while those with an ejection fraction ≥50 % were classified as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
Results: Over a mean follow-up period of 12.5 years, incident HF was diagnosed in 339 participants: 165 were classified as HFrEF and 138 as HFpEF. In fully adjusted models, the highest quartile of ePWV was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall HF (HR 4.79, 95 % CI 2.43-9.45) compared with the lowest quartile (reference).

We address the problem of negative direct side network effects that arise with an increased number of agents on one side of the platform. Negative effects, if unaddressed, lead to undesired long-term consequences for the platform by developing a positive vicious cycle. Addressing negative effects require dynamic solution mechanisms that adapt to the changing landscape of platforms. The recommender systems literature has proposed multi-sided recommender systems (MSR) as a dynamic solution to many problems on platforms. However, current state-of-the-art MSRs do not consider uncertainty in predicting agents’ choices, resulting in limited efficacy. We present a robust multi-sided recommender system that considers estimation errors in agents’ choice to address this concern. Extensive experiments with agent-based models—ride-pooling and education platform—provide support for the efficacy and generalizability of the robust MSR to address negative effects."

Early interventions targeting core neurocognitive deficits have the potential to confer long-term neurodevelopmental benefits. Time-targeted choline supplementation is one such intervention that has been shown to provide neurodevelopmental benefits that emerge with age during childhood. We present a long-term follow-up study evaluating the neurodevelopmental effects of early choline supplementation in children with FASD approximately 7 years on average after an initial efficacy trial.MethodsThe initial study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of choline vs. placebo in 2.5 to 5 year olds with FASD. Participants in this long-term follow-up study include 18 children (9 placebo; 9 choline) seen 7 years on average following initial trial completion. The mean age at follow-up was 11.0 years old. Diagnoses were 28% fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 28% partial FAS, and 44% alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. The follow-up included measures of executive functioning and an MRI scan.ResultsChildren who received choline had better performance on several tasks of lower-order executive function (e.g., processing speed) and showed higher white matter microstructure organization (i.e., greater axon coherence) in the splenium of the corpus callosum compared to the placebo group.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings, although exploratory at this stage, highlight potential long-term benefits of choline as a neurodevelopmental intervention for FASD and suggest that choline may affect white matter development, representing a potential target of choline in this population.Trial registrationPrior to enrollment, this trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01149538) on June 23, 2010."

However, it is still uncertain if structural and postural alterations leading to foot pronation could be compensated with more efficient function of the intrinsic foot muscles and how mobility and strength are associated. Additionally, the relationship between foot mobility and the strength of the intrinsic muscles that control the foot arch is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the morphological parameters between dominant and non-dominant feet and the relationship between the intrinsic foot muscle strength and foot mobility in recreational runners. We used a cross-sectional study design to evaluate twenty-four healthy recreational runners (minimum 15 km/week) with an average training history of 70 ± 60 months. Foot Posture Index (FPI-6), isometric intrinsic muscle strength, overall morphology, and normalized mobility of both feet were assessed. Parametric tests analyzed the unidimensional measures, and paired analysis determined differences between dominant and non-dominant sides. Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients determined the relationships between normalized strength and the variables of interest (CI = 95%). There was no significant association between intrinsic foot muscle strength and mobility. The only difference observed was between the dominant and non-dominant foot regarding the normalized foot length and midfoot width during non-weight-bearing, with small and medium effect sizes, respectively. Neither foot morphology nor foot mobility was associated with strength from intrinsic foot muscles in healthy recreational runners. Further work should explore the relationship investigated in our study with professional athletes and runners with symptomatic lower limb injuries to potentialize training and rehabilitation protocols."

Whereas some cross-cultural research exists about complex problem-solving predictors and performance, the process has rarely been studied. We presented participants from Brazil, Germany, the Philippines, and the United States with two computer-simulated dynamic problems, one where quick action was required - the WinFire simulation - and one where cautious action was required - the Coldstore simulation. Participants were asked to think aloud in their native language while working on these two tasks. These think-aloud protocols were digitally recorded, transcribed, and coded by coders in each country in terms of the steps involved in complex problem solving and dynamic decision making. For the current study, we developed a program to calculate transition frequencies from one problem solving step to another and analyzed only those protocols with more than 15 transitions. For WinFire, these were 256 think-aloud protocols from the four countries with a total of 12,542 statement, for Coldstore, these were 247 participants with a total of 15,237 statements. Based on previous, limited cross-cultural research, we predicted that after identifying a problem, Brazilians would make emotional and self-related statements, Germans would engage primarily in planning, Filipinos would gather additional information, and Americans would primarily state solutions. Results of latent transition analysis partially support these hypotheses, but only in the highly uncertain Coldstore situation and not in the more transparent WinFire situation. Transition frequencies were then also analyzed regarding community clusters using the spinglass algorithm in R, igraph. Results highlight the importance of process analyses in different tasks and show how cultural background guides people's decisions under uncertainty."

The study included 2514 health service areas and used multilevel mixed-effects linear model to account for the multilevel data structure. The outcome measure was the number of COVID-19 deaths. This study found that public health, as opposed to acute care provision, was associated with community health and, ultimately, COVID-19 mortality. The study found that population characteristics including more uninsured greater proportion of those over 65 years, more diverse populations, and larger populations were all associated with a higher rate of death. In addition, communities with fewer hospitals were associated with a lower rate of death. When considering region in the United States, the west region showed a higher rate of death than all other regions. The association between some community characteristics and higher COVID-19 deaths demonstrated that access to health care, either for COVID-19 infection or worse health from higher disease burden, is strongly associated with COVID-19 deaths. Thus, to be better prepared for potential future pandemics, a greater emphasis on public health infrastructure is needed."

Behavioral practitioners and researchers often engage in assessment and reporting of the meaningfulness of behavior change using social validity assessments. These assessments ensure that target behaviors are appropriately selected, intervention procedures are acceptable, and satisfactory outcomes are produced. The purpose of this review is to identify the current state of social validity within behavioral literature. We reviewed eight peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2020. We found that 47% of the intervention studies reviewed included a social validity assessment. Social validity assessment across journals has increased over time, with a significant rise from 2019 to 2020. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future work are discussed."

This leaves much to be understood as to the development of belief systems of teachers with Latinx heritage and how they relate to their students with disabilities. This study applied theories of critical race theory and funds of knowledge to better understand how the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of our teacher candidates were key to fostering the development of their teacher identities. This resulted in the development of the Cultivating Critical Consciousness in Educators Framework (CCCE), a comprehensible framework for understanding the beliefs and practices essential for educators to practice critical consciousness. Findings demonstrate within group diversity of beliefs varying along a continuum of dysconscious to critical consciousness related to systemic racism, ableism, discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender expression, and sociolinguistic issues. Implications for teacher education practice and future research also are shared."

Using their definition Savas and Patterson examined the relationship between Gauge integral and Summability theory. Because of the esoteric of both Gauge and Summability theory, the body of literature is limited. As such the only accessible notion to both theories is Pringsheim limits. The goal of this paper is to present a natural multidimensional extension of Gauge theory via Summability methods. To accomplish this we examine double measurable real-valued functions of the type of f (x, y) in the Gauge sense on (1,?)?(1,?). Additionally, we introduce the definition of double ?2 ?strongly summable to L with respect to Gauge and present inclusion theorems."

Education and training for most health-care providers to deliver nutrition care to patients have been inadequate and on the decline in the past several decades. This gap needs to be addressed by increasing the knowledge, confidence, and abilities of health-care professionals to deliver nutrition care and work as an interprofessional team for patients. Having a registered dietitian nutritionist as part of the interprofessional team can lead to better-coordinated care, using nutrition at the forefront. We describe the issues with a disparity in online nutrition-focused continuing professional development (CPD) and propose an avenue and strategy to use CPD to deliver nutrition education and training to providers, ultimately to boost interprofessional collaboration."

Despite the attention on planning, many studies have found that hospitals in the United States are underprepared to manage extended disasters appropriately and the surge in patient volume it might bring.
AIM: This study aims to profile and examine the availability of hospital capacity specifically related to COVID-19 patients, such as emergency department (ED) beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, temporary space setup, and ventilators.
METHOD: A cross-sectional retrospective study design was used to examine secondary data from the 2020 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey. A series of multivariate logistic analyses were conducted to investigate the strength of association between changes in ED beds, ICU beds, staffed beds, and temporary spaces setup, and the 3,655 hospitals' characteristics.
RESULTS: Our results highlight that the odds of a change in ED beds are 44 percent lower for government hospitals and 54 percent for for-profit hospitals than not-for-profit hospitals. The odds of ED bed change for nonteaching hospitals were 34 percent lower compared to teaching hospitals. Small and medium hospitals have significantly lower odds (75 and 51 percent, respectively) than large hospitals. For ICU bed change, staffed bed change, and temporary spaces setup, the conclusions were consistently significant regarding the impact of hospital ownership, teaching status, and hospital size. However, temporary spaces setup differs by hospital location. The odds of change is significantly lower (OR = 0.71) in urban hospitals compared with rural hospitals, while for ED beds, the odds of change is considerably higher (OR = 1.57) in urban hospitals compared to rural hospitals.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for policymakers to consider not only resource limitations that were created from supply line disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic but also a more global assessment of the adequacy of funding and support for insurance coverage, hospital finance, and how hospitals meet the needs of the populations they serve."
